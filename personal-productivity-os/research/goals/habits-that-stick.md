# Building Habits That Stick

## Why Habits Matter for Productivity

Habits reduce decision fatigue. When a behavior is automatic, it costs zero willpower. The person who habitually exercises in the morning does not decide to exercise every day — they just do it. This frees cognitive energy for work that actually requires thought.

## The Habit Formation Framework

### 1. Start Ridiculously Small
The biggest mistake is starting too big. "Meditate for 30 minutes daily" fails. "Meditate for 2 minutes daily" sticks. The goal is not the activity — it is building the neural pathway. Scale up after the habit is established.

**Examples of tiny starts:**
- "Write one sentence per day" (not "write 1000 words")
- "Do 5 pushups" (not "work out for an hour")
- "Read one page" (not "read 30 minutes")
- "Review one project" (not "full weekly review")

### 2. Anchor to Existing Behavior
Attach the new habit to something you already do:
- "After I pour my coffee, I write for 5 minutes"
- "After I close my laptop at end of day, I write tomorrow's top priority"
- "After my Monday team meeting, I do my weekly review"

The existing behavior is the trigger. No trigger, no habit.

### 3. Make It Easy
Remove friction for good habits. Add friction for bad habits.
- Want to exercise? Lay out clothes the night before.
- Want to reduce phone scrolling? Delete the app from home screen.
- Want to journal? Keep the notebook on your desk, open.
- Want to do weekly reviews? Set a recurring calendar event with the template linked.

### 4. Track It (Briefly)
A simple streak tracker provides motivation. Mark an X on a calendar for each day you complete the habit. The visual streak becomes something you do not want to break.

Do not over-track. One checkmark per habit per day is enough.

### 5. Expect Breaks
You will miss days. The habit is not broken by one miss — it is broken by two. If you miss once, do the smallest version the next day. Two minutes, one sentence, one pushup. Just do not miss twice in a row.

## Common Habit Traps

| Trap | Fix |
|------|-----|
| Starting too big | Cut the habit in half, then half again |
| No anchor | Attach to an existing daily behavior |
| Relying on motivation | Design the environment instead |
| All-or-nothing | Partial counts. 2 minutes beats 0 minutes. |
| Tracking too many at once | Build one habit at a time. Add the next after 30 days. |

## Habits Worth Building

For your personal productivity OS, consider these foundational habits:
1. **Daily capture**: Get everything out of your head (5 minutes)
2. **Weekly review**: Process, plan, reflect (15 minutes)
3. **Morning priority**: Write your top 3 priorities before opening email (2 minutes)
4. **End-of-day close**: Log what happened, set tomorrow's intention (5 minutes)

Start with one. Add the next after 30 days of consistency.
