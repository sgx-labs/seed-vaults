# Saying No — Frameworks for Prioritization

## The Core Problem

Every "yes" is a "no" to something else. Most people default to yes because saying no feels uncomfortable. The result: an overloaded calendar, scattered focus, and slow progress on what actually matters.

## Framework 1: The Hell Yes Test

If your reaction to a request is not "Hell yes!", it is a no. This sounds extreme, but it filters for alignment. Apply it to new commitments, not existing obligations.

**Use when**: Someone asks you to take on a new project, commitment, or responsibility.

## Framework 2: The Opportunity Cost Question

"If I say yes to this, what am I saying no to?"

Write it out explicitly:
- Saying yes to this committee → saying no to 3 hours/week of deep work
- Saying yes to this project → saying no to finishing the other project on time
- Saying yes to this meeting → saying no to my focus block

**Use when**: The request seems reasonable but you are already stretched.

## Framework 3: The Goal Filter

Check your goals in `current-state/goals.md`. Does this new request serve any active goal? If not, the default answer is no — unless there is a compelling reason to override.

**Use when**: You need an objective filter, not an emotional one.

## Framework 4: The Regret Test

Imagine it is three months from now. Which would you regret more: having said yes, or having said no? Future-you has better perspective than present-you, who is feeling social pressure.

**Use when**: You are unsure and feeling pressured in the moment.

## How to Actually Say No

### Direct and Kind
"Thank you for thinking of me. I can't take this on right now — I'm focused on [specific thing]. Can I suggest someone else?"

### Conditional No
"I can't do this in the timeframe you need. If the deadline were [later date], I could consider it."

### Redirect
"I can't lead this, but I could contribute 30 minutes of input on [specific aspect]."

### Delayed Response
"Let me check my commitments and get back to you by [date]." This breaks the immediacy bias. Many things seem urgent in the moment but are not.

## When to Say Yes

- It directly serves your top goals
- You are genuinely excited about it
- The cost is low and the learning is high
- Saying no would damage a relationship you value
- It is a genuine obligation (not just a request disguised as one)

## Building the Habit

Saying no is a skill. It gets easier with practice. Start with low-stakes nos (skipping optional meetings, declining newsletters, reducing commitments by one) and build up to bigger boundaries.

The people who respect your no are the ones worth saying yes to.
