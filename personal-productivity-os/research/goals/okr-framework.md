# OKRs for Individuals — Goal Setting That Works

## What OKRs Are

OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results. An Objective is what you want to achieve (qualitative, inspiring). Key Results are how you measure progress (quantitative, specific).

Originally designed for teams, the framework adapts well for personal use when simplified.

## The Structure

```
Objective: [What you want to achieve — aspirational]
  KR1: [Measurable indicator of progress]
  KR2: [Measurable indicator of progress]
  KR3: [Measurable indicator of progress]
```

### Example

```
Objective: Become a stronger technical leader
  KR1: Ship 2 cross-team projects by end of quarter
  KR2: Mentor 1 junior engineer (weekly 1:1s for 3 months)
  KR3: Give 1 internal tech talk
```

## Rules for Individual OKRs

### Objectives
- 2-3 per quarter (not more)
- Qualitative and motivating
- Answers "what direction am I heading?"
- Should feel slightly uncomfortable (stretch, not impossible)

### Key Results
- 2-4 per objective
- Measurable: you can grade them 0-100% at end of quarter
- Mix of output metrics (things you produce) and outcome metrics (results you achieve)
- 70% completion is a good target — 100% means you set the bar too low

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too many OKRs**: 2-3 objectives max. Focus beats breadth.
2. **Key results that are tasks**: "Launch the feature" is a task. "Increase user activation by 15%" is a key result.
3. **No connection to daily work**: Every week, check: did my work this week advance any key result?
4. **Never revising**: If a key result becomes irrelevant mid-quarter, update it. The goal is direction, not rigidity.
5. **All stretch, no foundation**: Balance aspirational goals with maintenance goals (keep existing systems running).

## Quarterly Cycle

1. **Week 1**: Set OKRs for the quarter. Define projects that serve each key result.
2. **Weekly**: Check progress against key results during weekly review.
3. **Monthly**: Score progress, adjust if needed.
4. **End of quarter**: Grade each KR (0-100%). Reflect. Set next quarter's OKRs.

## OKRs vs. Habits vs. Projects

| Type | Example | Tracking |
|------|---------|----------|
| OKR | "Increase revenue 20% this quarter" | Measure weekly, grade quarterly |
| Habit | "Write for 30 minutes every morning" | Streak tracking, daily |
| Project | "Redesign the onboarding flow" | Next actions, milestones |

You need all three. OKRs set direction. Habits build capacity. Projects deliver outcomes.
