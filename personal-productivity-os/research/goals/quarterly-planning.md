# How to Plan a Quarter

## Why Quarterly

A quarter is long enough to achieve something meaningful and short enough to course-correct. Annual goals drift. Monthly goals are too tactical. Quarters hit the sweet spot.

## The Planning Session (2-3 Hours)

### Step 1: Retrospective (30 min)
Before looking forward, look back.

- What were last quarter's goals?
- Which were achieved, partially achieved, or missed?
- What worked well in your process?
- What would you do differently?
- Any surprises — good or bad?

Write a brief paragraph summarizing the quarter. Add it to `current-state/goals.md` under completed goals.

### Step 2: Life/Work Audit (20 min)
Step back from tasks and assess the bigger picture:

- **Career**: Am I growing? Am I in the right role?
- **Skills**: What do I need to learn? What am I neglecting?
- **Relationships**: Am I investing in the right people?
- **Health**: Am I sustainable? Energy levels? Sleep?
- **Finances**: On track? Any actions needed?

Not all of these need quarterly goals. But awareness prevents blind spots.

### Step 3: Theme Selection (15 min)
Pick 2-3 themes for the quarter. Themes are broad areas of focus:

Examples:
- "Ship and learn" (launch things, get feedback)
- "Build the team" (hiring, mentoring, culture)
- "Simplify" (reduce commitments, automate, delegate)
- "Deep skill" (master one specific capability)

### Step 4: Goal Setting (30 min)
Under each theme, set 1-3 specific goals. Use the OKR format if helpful.

See: `research/goals/okr-framework.md`

For each goal:
- What does success look like?
- How will I measure it?
- What projects does this require?
- What is the first action?

### Step 5: Project Mapping (20 min)
Map goals to projects. Create or update project entries in `entities/projects.md` and `current-state/projects.md`. Each project should have a clear next action.

### Step 6: Calendar Review (15 min)
Look at the quarter's calendar:
- Any major events, travel, or deadlines?
- Where are the open blocks for deep work?
- Any commitments that conflict with your goals?

## After the Session

1. Update `current-state/goals.md` with new quarterly goals
2. Update `current-state/projects.md` with project plans
3. Set a calendar reminder for the first weekly review
4. Put the quarterly review on the calendar for end of quarter

## Common Traps

- **Planning too much**: 3-5 goals per quarter. More means less focus.
- **All output, no learning**: Include at least one growth/learning goal.
- **Ignoring constraints**: Account for vacations, recurring commitments, and realistic capacity.
- **Perfect plans**: The plan will change. That is fine. The value is in the thinking, not the document.
