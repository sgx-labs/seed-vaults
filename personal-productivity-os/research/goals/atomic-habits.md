# Atomic Habits — Identity-Based Behavior Change

## The Core Shift: Identity Over Outcomes

Most people set goals: "I want to lose 20 pounds." Atomic Habits flips this. Instead of focusing on what you want to achieve, focus on who you want to become.

- **Outcome-based:** "I want to run a marathon." (fragile — stops when the goal is reached or abandoned)
- **Identity-based:** "I am a runner." (durable — every run reinforces who you are)

The question to ask: "What would the type of person I want to become do right now?"

Every action is a vote for the type of person you are becoming. You do not need a unanimous vote. You need a majority.

## The Four Laws of Behavior Change

### 1. Make It Obvious (Cue)
Design your environment so the cue for the habit is visible and unavoidable.

- Put the book on the pillow so you see it at bedtime.
- Set out the workout clothes the night before.
- Keep the journal open on the desk.

**Implementation intention:** "I will [behavior] at [time] in [location]." Vague intentions fail. Specific ones stick.

### 2. Make It Attractive (Craving)
Pair the habit you need with something you want.

- **Temptation bundling:** "After I complete my weekly review, I will listen to my favorite podcast."
- **Social environment:** Surround yourself with people for whom the desired behavior is normal.

### 3. Make It Easy (Response)
Reduce friction. The fewer steps between you and the habit, the more likely it happens.

- **Two-minute rule:** Scale any habit down to something that takes two minutes. "Read before bed" becomes "read one page." The point is to show up. Mastery comes later.
- **Prime the environment:** Set up the night before so the morning habit requires zero decisions.

### 4. Make It Satisfying (Reward)
What is immediately rewarded gets repeated. What is immediately punished gets avoided.

- Use a habit tracker for visual progress (the streak itself becomes the reward).
- Never miss twice. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is a new habit forming.

## Habit Stacking

Anchor new habits to existing ones using this formula:

> "After I [current habit], I will [new habit]."

**Examples:**
- "After I sit down at my desk, I will write my top 3 priorities."
- "After I finish lunch, I will process my inbox to zero."
- "After I close my laptop for the day, I will write one sentence in my journal."

Chain multiple stacks to build a sequence, but start with one at a time.

## The 1% Improvement Compound Effect

Improving 1% every day results in a 37x improvement over a year. Declining 1% every day brings you to nearly zero. The math is exponential, but the experience is not — results lag behind effort, sometimes dramatically.

## The Plateau of Latent Potential

This is where most people quit. You put in weeks of effort and see nothing. You are in the Valley of Disappointment. The work is not wasted — it is being stored. Results appear suddenly after a long period of apparent stagnation, like an ice cube slowly warming from 25 to 31 degrees and then suddenly melting at 32.

**The practical takeaway:** When a habit feels pointless, check the calendar. If you have been at it for less than 8 weeks, you likely have not hit the compounding threshold yet. Keep going.

## Actionable Steps

1. **Pick one identity statement:** "I am the type of person who..." Write it down.
2. **Choose one small habit** that reinforces that identity. Scale it to two minutes.
3. **Stack it** onto an existing habit using the "After I..." formula.
4. **Track it visually.** A simple checkmark or streak counter.
5. **Protect the streak.** Never miss twice. If you miss, do the minimum version the next day.
6. **Review at 30 days.** Is the identity sticking? Scale up or adjust.

## How SAME Helps

- **Decision log** captures identity statements and the habits supporting them — the agent can surface these when you are drifting.
- **Session handoffs** naturally prompt "what did you do today?" which reinforces the daily habit loop.
- **`search_notes`** retrieves past habit experiments so you can see what worked and what did not, preventing the cycle of trying the same approach repeatedly.
- **`recent_activity`** shows your vault growing — a compound effect you can see.
