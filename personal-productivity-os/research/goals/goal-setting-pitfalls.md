# Goal Setting Pitfalls — Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

## Pitfall 1: Too Many Goals

**The mistake**: Setting 10 goals for the quarter because everything feels important.
**The problem**: With 10 goals, none get adequate focus. You end up at 20% on everything instead of 100% on two things.
**The fix**: Force-rank your goals. Pick 3-5 for the quarter. Move the rest to a someday/maybe list. Fewer goals, more progress.

## Pitfall 2: Vague Goals

**The mistake**: "Be healthier," "Get better at my job," "Save more money."
**The problem**: You cannot track progress on something you cannot measure. Vague goals become ambient guilt.
**The fix**: Add specifics. "Exercise 3 times per week." "Complete the advanced course by end of quarter." "Save $X per month."

## Pitfall 3: Only Outcome Goals

**The mistake**: Setting goals you cannot fully control. "Get promoted." "Win the contract." "Hit $X revenue."
**The problem**: External factors may prevent the outcome despite your best effort. This breeds helplessness.
**The fix**: Pair every outcome goal with a process goal you control. "Get promoted" becomes "complete 3 high-visibility projects and have the promotion conversation with my manager."

## Pitfall 4: No Connection to Daily Work

**The mistake**: Setting quarterly goals and then forgetting about them until the end of the quarter.
**The problem**: Goals that do not connect to weekly actions are wishes, not plans.
**The fix**: In every weekly review, ask: "Did this week's work advance my goals?" If not, something needs to change — either the goals or the work.

## Pitfall 5: Never Adjusting

**The mistake**: Treating goals as sacred commitments that cannot be changed.
**The problem**: Circumstances change. Clinging to obsolete goals wastes energy.
**The fix**: Monthly check-in. If a goal is no longer relevant, drop it or modify it. Document the change and the reason.

## Pitfall 6: No Celebration

**The mistake**: Achieving a goal and immediately moving to the next one.
**The problem**: Without acknowledgment, progress feels invisible. Motivation erodes.
**The fix**: When you complete a goal, mark it as complete. Note the date. Note what you learned. Then move forward.

## Pitfall 7: Goals as Obligation

**The mistake**: Goals that feel like someone else's expectations rather than your own ambitions.
**The problem**: Externally imposed goals get resisted or resented.
**The fix**: For each goal, answer: "Why do I want this?" If the honest answer is "I don't, but I think I should," reconsider.

## Pitfall 8: Ignoring Energy and Capacity

**The mistake**: Setting goals as if you have unlimited time and energy.
**The problem**: Overcommitment leads to burnout, not achievement.
**The fix**: Before committing to goals, audit your capacity. Account for existing commitments, recovery time, and the unexpected.
