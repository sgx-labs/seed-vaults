# Annual Themes — Direction Without Rigidity

## Why Themes Over Resolutions

New Year's resolutions fail because they are rigid, binary, and disconnected from daily life. "Lose 20 pounds" is either achieved or not — and by February, most people have given up.

Themes are different. A theme is a general direction for the year, not a specific target. It guides decisions without creating pass/fail pressure.

## What a Theme Looks Like

A theme is a short phrase — usually "Year of [Something]":

| Theme | What it means in practice |
|-------|--------------------------|
| Year of Health | Prioritize sleep, exercise, and nutrition in decisions |
| Year of Depth | Fewer projects, deeper engagement with each |
| Year of Shipping | Finish and release things instead of starting new ones |
| Year of Relationships | Invest time in people, not just work |
| Year of Learning | Take courses, read widely, build new skills |
| Year of Simplicity | Reduce commitments, possessions, complexity |

## How Themes Work

### Decision Filter
When facing a choice, ask: "Does this serve my theme?" The person with a "Year of Depth" theme declines a new side project. The person with a "Year of Shipping" theme chooses to polish an existing project instead of starting a new one.

### No Failure Mode
You cannot fail a theme. "Year of Health" does not require perfect adherence. Even if you only improved your sleep by 30 minutes and added two walks per week, the year was themed correctly.

### Flexibility
Themes adapt to changing circumstances. "Year of Learning" might mean courses in Q1, books in Q2, mentorship in Q3, and hands-on experimentation in Q4. The direction stays constant; the expression varies.

## Choosing Your Theme

1. Reflect on last year: what was missing? What do you wish you had prioritized?
2. Look at your current situation: what would make the biggest difference?
3. Consider your goals: what theme would make your quarterly goals easier?
4. Pick one (or at most two). Write it where you will see it regularly.

## Combining Themes With Quarterly Goals

- **Annual theme** sets the direction (Year of Shipping)
- **Quarterly goals** set the milestones (Ship project A in Q1, project B in Q2)
- **Weekly priorities** set the actions (This week: finish the user flow for project A)
- **Daily planning** sets the execution (Today: design the login screen)

Each level becomes more specific, but all serve the same theme.

## In Your System

Record your annual theme in `current-state/goals.md`. Reference it in quarterly planning and monthly reviews. The agent can surface it when you are making decisions about new commitments.
