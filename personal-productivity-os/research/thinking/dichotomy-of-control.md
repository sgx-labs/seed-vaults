# Dichotomy of Control — Focus on What You Can Change

## The Principle

Epictetus, a Stoic philosopher, stated it simply: "Some things are within our power, while others are not." The practice is learning to tell the difference and acting accordingly.

**Within your control:**
- Your effort and preparation
- Your response to events
- Your attitude and perspective
- How you spend your time
- What you choose to focus on
- Whether you ask for help

**Not within your control:**
- Other people's opinions, decisions, or reactions
- Weather, traffic, market conditions
- Past events
- Whether someone responds to your message
- The outcome of a job interview
- A deadline being moved by leadership

## Why This Matters for Productivity

Most anxiety, frustration, and wasted energy come from trying to control things outside your control.

- Refreshing your inbox every 5 minutes will not make the reply arrive faster.
- Worrying about a decision your manager will make does not influence the decision.
- Rehearsing an argument with a colleague in your head does not change their position.

The energy spent on uncontrollables is energy stolen from what you can actually change.

## The Practice

### Before Reacting, Ask Three Questions

1. **"Is this within my control?"** If no, let it go. Not passively — deliberately. Acknowledge it and redirect your attention.
2. **"What part of this IS within my control?"** Almost every situation has some controllable element. A project delay (not your fault) still has your response (your choice).
3. **"What is the most useful thing I can do right now?"** This shifts from rumination to action.

### Applied to Common Work Situations

| Situation | Not In Your Control | In Your Control |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Project deadline moved up | The new deadline | How you re-prioritize, what you cut, how you communicate constraints |
| Negative feedback received | That it was given | How you process it, what you learn, whether you act on it |
| Colleague not pulling their weight | Their behavior | Your conversation with them, escalation if needed, your own output |
| Job application rejected | The hiring decision | Your next application, what you improve, how many you send |
| Meeting runs over your deep work block | Other people's talking | Leaving on time, rescheduling your block, setting boundaries |

### The Anxiety Reduction Effect

When you genuinely internalize this framework, a large portion of daily worry simply disappears. Not because the problems go away, but because you stop spending mental energy on the parts you cannot change.

This is not passivity. It is strategic focus. You are not giving up — you are directing your limited energy toward the highest-leverage actions.

## The Subtle Trap: Learned Helplessness

The dichotomy of control can be misused. "I can't control the outcome, so why try?" is not Stoic — it is resignation. The framework says: control your effort, your preparation, your response. Those require action, not surrender.

The test: are you using "I can't control that" to avoid doing the hard thing you can control? If so, you have flipped the framework.

## Actionable Steps

1. **The next time you feel anxious about work**, write down what is bothering you. Split it into two columns: "In My Control" and "Not In My Control."
2. **Cross out the "Not In My Control" column.** Not because those things do not matter, but because worrying about them does not help.
3. **Pick one action from the "In My Control" column** and do it right now.
4. **In your weekly review**, look back at what consumed your mental energy. How much was controllable? How much was not?
5. **Track the pattern over a month.** Most people discover they spend 60-80% of their worry budget on uncontrollables.

## How SAME Helps

- **Decision log** captures what you chose to focus on, building a pattern of growth in directing energy toward controllables.
- **`search_notes`** for "frustrated" or "stuck" reveals whether past blockers were controllable — often they were not, and the solution was redirecting effort.
- **Session handoffs** naturally frame work in terms of actions taken (controllable) rather than outcomes hoped for (not controllable).
- The agent can prompt the three-question check when you express frustration during a session.
