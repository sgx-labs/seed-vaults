# Fear-Setting: A Framework for Decisions You're Avoiding

Most productivity advice assumes the problem is not knowing what to do. But often you know exactly what to do — you're just afraid to do it.

## The Problem

We avoid hard decisions because the fear is vague and unbounded. "What if it doesn't work out?" is terrifying precisely because it's undefined. Your brain fills in the worst possible interpretation and then treats that as the likely outcome.

Vague fear is paralyzing. Specific fear is manageable.

## The Technique

Tim Ferriss developed this framework (inspired by Stoic premeditatio malorum) and described it in his 2017 TED talk. It has three columns and one critical follow-up question.

### Column 1: Define

Write down the decision you're avoiding. Then list every specific bad thing that could happen if you take action.

Not "it could go wrong" — specific outcomes. What would actually happen?

- I could lose $X
- The relationship could end
- I might look foolish in front of Y people
- I could be unemployed for Z months

Make the fear concrete. Name it.

### Column 2: Prevent

For each fear, what could you do to reduce the probability of it happening?

- "I could lose $X" → Set a maximum loss threshold. Start with a smaller test. Keep 6 months of expenses in reserve
- "I might look foolish" → Talk to 3 people who've done this before. Start quietly. Build evidence before going public

Most fears are partially preventable. Not fully — but partially is enough.

### Column 3: Repair

If the worst case actually happens, what would you do to recover?

This is the most important column. Because the answer is almost always: "I would figure it out." You'd get another job. You'd rebuild. You'd adjust. Humans are remarkably resilient at recovery — and remarkably bad at remembering that in advance.

### The Critical Follow-Up: Cost of Inaction

Now flip it. What is the cost of NOT deciding?

What does your life look like in 6 months if you do nothing? In 1 year? In 3 years?

This is where fear-setting gets its power. The fear of action is vivid and immediate. The cost of inaction is invisible and slow. Writing it down makes it visible.

Often, the cost of inaction is far worse than any realistic downside of action. You just couldn't see it because it accumulates gradually.

## Worked Example

**Decision I'm avoiding:** Leaving a stable job to work on my own project.

| Define (fears) | Prevent | Repair |
|---|---|---|
| Run out of money in 4 months | Save 8 months of expenses first. Start project as a side effort before quitting | Freelance in my field. I have skills and a network. Could find contract work within 4-6 weeks |
| Project fails publicly | Launch quietly. Test with 10 users before any public announcement | A failed project is a resume line, not a career-ender. Most people won't notice or care |
| Feel isolated working alone | Join a co-working space. Schedule weekly calls with peers | Go back to a team environment. I'll have new skills and perspective |

**Cost of inaction:**
- 6 months: still thinking about it, growing resentful at current job
- 1 year: the window feels like it's closing, regret building
- 3 years: deep regret, wondering "what if", possibly still in the same role

## When to Use

- Career changes, role transitions
- Starting a business or side project
- Ending something that isn't working (a project, a commitment, a relationship)
- Any decision where you've been "thinking about it" for more than 2 weeks without acting
- Confrontations you've been avoiding
- Financial decisions that feel risky

## When NOT to Use

- Decisions you're not actually afraid of (use a simpler pro/con list)
- Situations where you need more information, not more courage (do the research first)
- Trivial or easily reversible decisions (just try it)

## How SAME Helps

- **`save_decision`** captures the full fear-set analysis — all three columns plus the cost of inaction. This prevents re-litigation. When the same fear resurfaces at 2am, you can search for it and find your own structured analysis instead of spiraling
- **Search past fear-setting exercises** to see patterns. If "fear of looking foolish" appears in five different exercises, that's your pattern to work on — not a project-specific concern
- The vault holds your own evidence that fears are usually manageable. That evidence accumulates and becomes genuinely reassuring over time
