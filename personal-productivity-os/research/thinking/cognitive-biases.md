# Cognitive Biases That Hijack Productivity

Biases aren't character flaws — they're shortcuts your brain takes to save energy. They served us well in survival situations. They serve us poorly when planning projects, evaluating evidence, or deciding what to work on next.

You cannot eliminate biases. You can learn to notice them.

## Planning Fallacy

**What it is:** Everything takes longer than you think, even when you account for the fact that everything takes longer than you think.

**What it looks like at work:** You estimate a task will take 2 hours. It takes 5. You estimate a project will take 2 weeks. It takes 6. You've seen this pattern dozens of times and you still underestimate the next one.

**Why it happens:** When planning, you imagine the best-case scenario — smooth execution, no interruptions, no unknowns. You ignore your own historical data.

**Counter-strategy:** Use reference class forecasting. Don't ask "how long will this take?" Ask "how long did similar things take in the past?" Multiply your estimate by 1.5-3x depending on how novel the task is. Daniel Kahneman's research consistently shows this is one of the strongest and most persistent biases.

## Sunk Cost Fallacy

**What it is:** Continuing to invest in something because you've already invested, not because it's still the best use of your resources.

**What it looks like at work:** You've spent 3 months on a feature. It's clearly not working. But you keep going because "we've already put so much into it." The time is gone regardless of what you do next.

**Why it happens:** Loss aversion — we feel losses about twice as strongly as equivalent gains (Kahneman & Tversky, prospect theory). Abandoning feels like losing.

**Counter-strategy:** Ask: "If I were starting fresh today with no history, would I choose to invest in this?" If the answer is no, stop. The past investment is irrelevant to the future decision.

## Confirmation Bias

**What it is:** Seeking, interpreting, and remembering information that confirms what you already believe. Ignoring or discounting evidence that contradicts it.

**What it looks like at work:** You believe a new tool will solve your team's problems. You read glowing reviews, skip the critical ones, and interpret ambiguous results as positive. You've already decided — you're just building a case.

**Why it happens:** Contradictory evidence is psychologically uncomfortable (cognitive dissonance). Your brain avoids the discomfort by filtering.

**Counter-strategy:** Actively seek disconfirming evidence. Before making a decision, ask: "What would change my mind?" If you can't answer that, you're not evaluating — you're justifying.

## Anchoring

**What it is:** Over-relying on the first piece of information you encounter, even when it's arbitrary or irrelevant.

**What it looks like at work:** A vendor quotes $50,000. You negotiate down to $35,000 and feel great. But you never asked whether the project should cost $15,000 in the first place. The anchor set the range.

**Why it happens:** The brain uses the anchor as a reference point and adjusts from there — but adjustments are almost always insufficient (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).

**Counter-strategy:** Generate your own anchor before receiving external ones. Do independent research first. When you receive a number, consciously ask: "Is this anchor based on anything meaningful, or is it arbitrary?"

## Status Quo Bias

**What it is:** Preferring the current state of things simply because it's the current state, even when a change would clearly be better.

**What it looks like at work:** You keep using a tool you've outgrown. You stay in a role that no longer fits. You avoid reorganizing a process because "it works well enough." The switching cost feels disproportionately large.

**Why it happens:** Change involves uncertainty, effort, and potential loss. The current state feels safe because it's known — not because it's optimal.

**Counter-strategy:** Ask: "If I were starting from scratch, would I choose this?" (Same question as the sunk cost counter-strategy — these biases are cousins.) Also: schedule periodic reviews of your defaults.

## Availability Heuristic

**What it is:** Judging the probability or importance of something by how easily examples come to mind, rather than by actual data.

**What it looks like at work:** A dramatic production outage happened last month, so you overweight infrastructure risk in every planning conversation — even though it was a one-time event. Meanwhile, the slow, invisible problem (customer churn from poor onboarding) gets ignored because it's not vivid.

**Why it happens:** Vivid, recent, or emotionally charged events are easier to recall, so your brain treats them as more common or important.

**Counter-strategy:** Ask: "Am I judging this by data or by what comes to mind easily?" Look at actual frequency data. Keep logs — they beat memory every time.

## When to Use This Knowledge

- **Before estimating:** Assume the planning fallacy is active. Use historical data, not optimism
- **When something isn't working:** Check for sunk cost. Would you start this today?
- **When you feel certain:** Check for confirmation bias. What evidence would change your mind?
- **When evaluating numbers:** Check for anchoring. Where did the first number come from?
- **When resisting change:** Check for status quo bias. Is "good enough" actually good enough?
- **When assessing risk:** Check for availability. Are you reacting to data or to a vivid memory?

## How SAME Helps

- **Decision log reveals bias patterns over time.** After 20+ logged decisions, you can search for patterns: "How often did my estimates miss? In what direction? By how much?"
- **Search past decisions** before making new ones — your own historical data is the best antidote to the planning fallacy and availability heuristic
- The act of writing a decision down forces slower, more deliberate thinking — which is when biases lose their power
