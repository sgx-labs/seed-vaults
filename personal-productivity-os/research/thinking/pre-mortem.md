# Pre-Mortem: Imagine This Failed. Why?

A post-mortem asks "what went wrong?" after a failure. A pre-mortem asks the same question *before you start* — while you can still do something about it.

## The Technique

Before starting a project, making a commitment, or launching something:

1. Imagine it's 6 months (or 1 year) in the future
2. The project has failed completely
3. Write down every reason why it failed

That's it. The key shift is not "could this fail?" but "this failed — why?"

## Why It Works

The psychological trick is subtle but powerful. When you ask "what could go wrong?", people self-censor. They don't want to seem negative, unsupportive, or pessimistic. They hold back legitimate concerns.

But when you say "this already failed — tell me why," you give people permission to voice concerns without feeling like they're being difficult. The question changes from prediction (risky, socially costly) to explanation (safe, intellectually interesting).

**Gary Klein's research** (published in Harvard Business Review, 2007) found that prospective hindsight — imagining an event has already occurred — increases the ability to correctly identify reasons for future outcomes by **30%**. This isn't a minor improvement. It's a significant jump in the quality of risk identification.

## Step-by-Step Personal Pre-Mortem

You don't need a team for this. A solo pre-mortem works just as well.

**Step 1: Set the scene (2 minutes)**
Write down the project, decision, or commitment. State the timeline.

**Step 2: Declare failure (1 minute)**
Write: "It is [date]. This has failed completely."

**Step 3: List every reason (10-15 minutes)**
Free-write. Don't filter. Include:
- Things within your control (you didn't do X)
- Things outside your control (market shifted, dependency broke)
- Personal reasons (you lost motivation, got distracted, overcommitted)
- Structural reasons (wrong team, wrong timing, wrong approach)
- Assumption failures (something you assumed was true turned out to be false)

**Step 4: Sort by likelihood and impact (5 minutes)**
Which failure modes are most likely? Which would be most damaging? Focus on the intersection — high likelihood AND high impact.

**Step 5: Mitigate the top 3-5 (10 minutes)**
For each top risk: what specific action could prevent or reduce it? Add these actions to your plan.

## Example

**Project:** Launch a weekly newsletter

**Pre-mortem reasons for failure:**
- Ran out of content ideas by week 8
- Spent too long on each edition (perfectionism)
- Didn't build a subscriber pipeline, so readership stayed flat
- Lost motivation because nobody responded or engaged
- Other commitments crowded it out — newsletter became lowest priority
- Chose a topic I thought was "strategic" instead of one I genuinely enjoy writing about

**Top mitigations:**
- Build a 20-idea backlog before launching (content runway)
- Set a time cap: 90 minutes max per edition
- Ask for replies in every edition. Track open rates, not just subscribers

## When to Use

- Before any project that will take more than 2 weeks
- Before making a major commitment (new role, partnership, client engagement)
- Before a product launch or public release
- When you feel unusually optimistic about something — that's exactly when blind spots are largest
- At the start of a quarter when setting goals

## When NOT to Use

- For trivial decisions (what to have for lunch)
- When you're already anxious and catastrophizing — in that case, use fear-setting instead, which structures the anxiety rather than amplifying it
- When the decision is easily reversible — just try it

## How SAME Helps

- **Log pre-mortem findings as decisions** using `save_decision`. Record the top risks and your mitigations. When the project is underway, search for them to check if any predicted failure modes are materializing
- **Search past pre-mortems** to find patterns. If "lost motivation after 6 weeks" shows up in three different pre-mortems, that's a signal about how you work — not about any specific project
- Over time, your pre-mortem archive becomes a personalized risk library — the failure modes you're actually prone to, not generic risk categories
