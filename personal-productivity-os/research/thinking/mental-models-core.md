# Core Mental Models Toolkit

Mental models are thinking tools. They don't tell you what to decide — they help you see the problem more clearly before you decide. These five are the most broadly useful across work and life.

## First Principles Thinking

Strip a problem down to its fundamental truths and rebuild your reasoning from there. Instead of reasoning by analogy ("this is how it's always been done"), ask: what do we actually know to be true?

**Practical example:** Instead of "we need to hire because the team is overwhelmed," ask: what work actually needs to happen? Could any of it be automated, eliminated, or restructured? What's the real bottleneck?

**Origin:** Aristotle called it "the first basis from which a thing is known." Elon Musk popularized its modern use in engineering and business contexts.

## Inversion

Instead of asking "how do I succeed?", ask "how would I definitely fail?" Then avoid those things. Problems that are hard to solve forward are often easy to solve backward.

**Practical example:** Planning a product launch? Instead of listing what could go right, list every way the launch could be a disaster. No documentation. No onboarding flow. Broken payment page. Now make sure none of those things happen.

**Origin:** Carl Jacobi, the mathematician: "Invert, always invert." Charlie Munger brought it into decision-making.

## Second-Order Thinking

Ask "and then what?" at least twice. First-order thinking looks at the immediate consequence. Second-order thinking looks at the consequences of the consequences.

**Practical example:** First-order: "If we cut prices, we'll get more customers." Second-order: "More customers means more support load. Can we handle it? Will margins survive? Will it attract the wrong customer segment?"

**Origin:** Howard Marks (Oaktree Capital) considers this the defining trait of superior investors — thinking about what happens next, not just what happens first.

## Map vs. Territory

Your mental model of reality is not reality itself. The map is useful, but it's always incomplete, sometimes outdated, and occasionally wrong. When the map and the territory conflict, trust the territory.

**Practical example:** Your project plan says you're on track. But three team members look stressed and two deadlines slipped quietly. The plan (map) is clean. The reality (territory) is messy. Update the map.

**Origin:** Alfred Korzybski's general semantics (1931). Nassim Taleb applies it extensively to risk and uncertainty.

## Circle of Competence

Know what you know and, more importantly, know what you don't know. Operating inside your circle of competence means fewer blind spots. Operating outside it requires extra caution, advisors, or deliberate learning.

**Practical example:** You're great at product design but mediocre at financial modeling. When making a pricing decision, either invest time to genuinely learn the finance, or bring in someone who lives in that circle. Don't wing it and call it intuition.

**Origin:** Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger use this as their primary filter for investment decisions — they simply refuse to operate outside their circle.

## When to Use

- **Starting a new project:** First principles + inversion (what's actually true? what would guarantee failure?)
- **Making a strategic decision:** Second-order thinking (then what? then what after that?)
- **Feeling overconfident:** Map vs. territory (is my model actually matching reality?)
- **Entering unfamiliar territory:** Circle of competence (do I know enough, or do I need help?)
- **Stuck on a problem:** Try a different model — if forward reasoning isn't working, try inversion

## How SAME Helps

- **`save_decision`** logs which mental model you applied and why, building a personal record of your reasoning patterns
- **`search_notes`** finds past situations where you used these models — reinforcing the habit and revealing which models you underuse
- The vault acts as an external thinking record. Instead of re-deriving insights, you search for them
