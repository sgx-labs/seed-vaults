# Implementation Intentions: The Most ADHD-Friendly Habit Technique

If you only learn one behavior change technique, make it this one. It's simple, backed by decades of research, and it works especially well for people who struggle with follow-through.

## The Science

Peter Gollwitzer (NYU) has studied implementation intentions since 1999. The core finding, replicated across 94+ studies in a meta-analysis by Gollwitzer & Sheeran (2006):

**"If-then" plans increase follow-through by 2-3x compared to motivation or goal-setting alone.**

The effect size is medium-to-large (d = 0.65), which is unusually strong for a behavioral intervention. It works across domains: health, academic performance, work habits, exercise, and more.

## Why It Works

When you set a goal ("I want to exercise more"), you rely on motivation and willpower in the moment. When the moment comes, you have to: (1) notice the opportunity, (2) decide what to do, (3) overcome inertia, and (4) act. That's four points of failure.

An implementation intention pre-loads the decision. You've already decided what you'll do and when. When the trigger situation occurs, the behavior fires almost automatically — like a reflex you designed.

This is why it's particularly effective for ADHD: it reduces the executive function demands at the moment of action. You don't need to remember, prioritize, or decide. You just respond to the trigger.

## The Formula

**"When [specific situation], I will [specific behavior]."**

Both parts must be specific:
- Not "when I have free time" — when exactly?
- Not "I'll work on my project" — what specific action?

## Good Examples

- "When I sit down at my desk on Monday morning, I will open the project brief before checking email"
- "When I finish lunch, I will walk around the block once before going back to my desk"
- "When I feel the urge to check social media during a work block, I will write down what I was doing and return to it"
- "When the weekly review reminder fires on Friday at 3pm, I will close all tabs and open my review template"
- "When someone asks me to take on a new commitment, I will say 'let me check my calendar and get back to you' before answering"

## Bad Examples (and Why)

- "I will exercise more" — no trigger, no specific behavior
- "When I feel motivated, I will work out" — "feeling motivated" isn't a reliable, observable trigger
- "When I wake up, I will do my entire morning routine" — too large; chain smaller intentions instead
- "I will not eat junk food" — avoidance intentions are weaker than approach intentions; reframe as "When I want a snack, I will eat an apple first"

## Stacking: Chaining Intentions for Routines

Once a single implementation intention is reliable, you can chain them:

1. "When my alarm goes off, I will put my feet on the floor" (not "get up and be productive")
2. "When my feet hit the floor, I will walk to the kitchen"
3. "When I reach the kitchen, I will fill the kettle"
4. "When the kettle is on, I will open my journal"

Each step is tiny. Each one triggers the next. The chain builds a routine without requiring you to hold the whole sequence in working memory.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too vague:** "When I have time" is not a trigger. Use specific, observable cues
2. **Too ambitious:** "When I wake up, I will work for 3 hours" sets up failure. Start embarrassingly small
3. **No environmental trigger:** The best triggers are things you can see, hear, or physically encounter — not internal states like "when I feel ready"
4. **Too many at once:** Start with 1-2. Add more only after the first ones are automatic (usually 2-3 weeks)
5. **Forgetting the rehearsal:** Mentally rehearse the if-then plan a few times. Visualization strengthens the link between trigger and behavior

## When to Use

- Building any new habit or routine
- Breaking a pattern of procrastination on a specific task
- Preparing for situations where you usually make poor choices
- After any planning session: convert plans into implementation intentions
- When you notice yourself saying "I should..." — that's a signal to create an if-then plan

## How SAME Helps

- After any planning session, the agent can prompt: "What's your implementation intention for this?" — converting vague plans into specific if-then commitments
- **Search past intentions** to see which ones stuck and which didn't. The ones that failed often have the same structural flaw (too vague, too ambitious, no environmental trigger)
- Log implementation intentions alongside goals so that every goal has at least one concrete trigger-behavior pair attached to it
