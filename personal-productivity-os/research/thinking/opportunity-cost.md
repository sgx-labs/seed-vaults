# Opportunity Cost: Every Yes Is a No to Something Else

This is the most important concept in economics, and possibly the most underused concept in personal productivity.

## Definition

Opportunity cost is the value of the best alternative you gave up when you made a choice. It's not what you spent — it's what you could have done instead.

When you spend an hour in a meeting, the opportunity cost is whatever else you would have done with that hour. When you commit to a project, the opportunity cost is the other project you can't do.

Every choice has one. Most of the time, we ignore it.

## Why Knowledge Workers Are Terrible at This

In most jobs, the cost of saying yes is invisible. Nobody sends you an invoice for the project you didn't start, the thinking time you didn't protect, or the rest you didn't get.

The cost of saying yes is felt as:
- Feeling overwhelmed (too many commitments)
- Shallow work (not enough time to go deep on anything)
- Chronic exhaustion (no margin for recovery or thinking)
- Stalled progress on what matters most (crowded out by what's urgent)

But these costs are diffuse and delayed. The reward for saying yes is immediate and social — you look helpful, collaborative, and committed.

This asymmetry means most people systematically over-commit.

## The Framework: Name What You're Saying No To

Before saying yes to anything significant, complete this sentence:

**"By saying yes to [this], I am saying no to [what?]."**

You must actually name the thing. Not "something else" — a specific activity, project, or outcome.

Examples:
- "By saying yes to this committee, I am saying no to two deep-work afternoons per month"
- "By saying yes to this client project, I am saying no to product development for the next 6 weeks"
- "By saying yes to this social event, I am saying no to the evening recovery time I need after a long week"

Sometimes the trade-off is worth it. Often, once you name it, it clearly isn't.

## Time as the Ultimate Finite Resource

Money can be earned, saved, invested, and recovered. Time cannot. Every hour has exactly one use, and then it's gone.

This makes time-based opportunity costs the most important ones to track. Yet we treat time as if it's infinite — filling every available slot, then wondering why we feel depleted.

A useful question: **"Is this the best use of my next hour?"** You don't need to answer it constantly. But asking it once a day about your biggest time commitment changes your allocation over time.

## The "Hell Yes or No" Heuristic

Derek Sivers proposed a simple filter: "If it's not a 'hell yes,' it's a no."

The reasoning: when you say yes to something mediocre, you're using a slot that could hold something great. If your calendar is full of "sure, I guess" commitments, there's no room for the opportunity that makes you genuinely excited.

This heuristic is aggressive, and it's not always practical. But it's a useful corrective if your default is to say yes to everything.

A gentler version: "Would I be excited about this if it were happening tomorrow?" (Not in 3 months when it feels abstract — tomorrow, when you'd actually have to do it.)

## The Paradox of Busy

Being busy feels productive. It isn't, necessarily. Busyness often means you've failed to make choices — you've said yes to everything and let your calendar make your priorities for you.

The most productive people tend to have surprisingly open calendars. Not because they don't work hard, but because they protect their time fiercely and only commit to things with high value relative to the alternative.

## When to Use

- Before accepting any new commitment that will take more than 2 hours total
- During weekly reviews: look at next week's calendar and ask "what is this costing me?"
- When you feel overwhelmed: you probably have an opportunity cost problem, not a time management problem
- Before starting a new project: what current project will get less attention?
- When someone asks you to do something and your gut says "I should, but..."

## How SAME Helps

- **Search past decisions** to see what you've already committed to before adding more. The vault holds the record of your current obligations — use it before saying yes to new ones
- **Track the pattern of yes.** Over months, your decision log reveals what you tend to say yes to (and what gets crowded out as a result). This pattern is invisible without a record
- The act of logging a new commitment alongside its opportunity cost makes the trade-off explicit — and harder to ignore
