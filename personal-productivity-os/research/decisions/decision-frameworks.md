# Decision Frameworks — Choosing the Right Tool

## Why Use Frameworks

Decisions feel hard because they are cognitively expensive. Frameworks reduce the cost by giving you a repeatable process. Instead of reinventing your approach every time, you pick the framework that fits and work through it.

## Framework 1: Two-Door Test (Reversibility Check)

**Ask**: Is this decision reversible?

- **One-way door** (irreversible): Quitting a job, signing a lease, having a child. These deserve thorough analysis. Take your time. Gather data. Consult trusted people.
- **Two-way door** (reversible): Choosing a tool, trying a new process, accepting a meeting. Decide quickly and correct course if needed. Speed matters more than precision.

Most decisions feel like one-way doors but are actually two-way doors. Default to deciding faster.

## Framework 2: Weighted Pros and Cons

For decisions with multiple factors, not all factors are equally important.

1. List all options
2. List the criteria that matter
3. Weight each criterion (1-5 scale)
4. Score each option against each criterion
5. Multiply scores by weights. Highest total wins.

**Use when**: Comparing 2-4 concrete options with clear criteria (choosing a vendor, selecting a tool, picking between job offers).

## Framework 3: Pre-Mortem

**Ask**: Assume we made this decision and it failed spectacularly. What went wrong?

1. Pick the option you are leaning toward
2. Imagine it is 6 months later and it failed
3. Write down all the reasons it could have failed
4. Assess which failure modes are likely and preventable
5. If the risks are manageable, proceed. If not, reconsider.

**Use when**: You have a strong gut preference but want to stress-test it.

## Framework 4: 10-10-10

**Ask**: How will I feel about this decision in:
- 10 minutes?
- 10 months?
- 10 years?

This framework surfaces temporal bias. Many decisions feel urgent in the moment but are irrelevant long-term, and vice versa.

**Use when**: Emotional pressure is clouding your judgment.

## Framework 5: Advice Test

**Ask**: What would I advise my best friend to do in this situation?

We are better at giving advice than following it because advice-giving activates rational thinking while personal decisions activate emotional processing.

**Use when**: You feel stuck in indecision.

## Framework 6: The Default

Not every decision needs a framework. For low-stakes, reversible decisions:
- If both options are roughly equal, pick one and move on
- Time spent deciding is time not spent doing
- "Good enough now" beats "perfect eventually"

## Choosing a Framework

| Situation | Framework |
|-----------|-----------|
| Quick, reversible choice | Two-door test → decide fast |
| Comparing options with clear criteria | Weighted pros and cons |
| Strong preference, want to validate | Pre-mortem |
| Emotional or pressured decision | 10-10-10 |
| Stuck in analysis paralysis | Advice test |
| Low stakes | Just pick one |

## After Deciding

Log the decision: `decisions/log.md`. Include the rationale. Future-you will appreciate it.
