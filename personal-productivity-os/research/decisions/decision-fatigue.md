# Decision Fatigue in Practice

## How It Relates to Decisions

Decision fatigue is covered in detail in `research/energy/decision-fatigue.md` from the energy management perspective. This note focuses specifically on how it affects the quality of your decisions and what to do about it.

## The Impact on Decision Quality

### Morning Decisions
- More analytical and deliberate
- Better at weighing trade-offs
- More likely to consider long-term consequences
- More creative in generating options

### Late-Day Decisions
- More impulsive or avoidant
- Default to the status quo
- Anchored to the first option presented
- More likely to defer ("I'll decide tomorrow")

## Practical Rules

### Rule 1: Schedule Important Decisions for the Morning
If you have a significant decision to make this week, block 30 minutes in the morning for it. Do not let it become an end-of-day afterthought.

### Rule 2: Never Decide While Depleted
If you notice you are struggling to decide, that is the signal to stop. Sleep on it. Morning clarity is not a myth — it is the absence of fatigue.

### Rule 3: Limit Decisions Per Day
Aim to make no more than 2-3 significant decisions per day. If you have more, spread them across the week. Batch minor decisions to reduce their cumulative impact.

### Rule 4: Use Pre-Made Rules
Every recurring decision you can convert to a rule is one less decision to make:
- "I always read the proposal before the meeting" (no more deciding whether to prep)
- "I review my goals every Monday morning" (no more deciding when to review)
- "I say no to meetings without agendas" (no more evaluating each request)

### Rule 5: Decide Once
When you make a decision, log it and move on. Re-opening settled decisions is one of the most wasteful forms of decision fatigue. This is why the decision log exists.

## The Decision Budget

Think of your daily decision capacity as a budget. You have a limited number of quality decisions per day. Spend them on what matters:

| Worth the budget | Not worth the budget |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Strategic direction | What to eat for lunch |
| Hiring choices | Which meeting room to book |
| Project prioritization | Email wording |
| Commitment boundaries | Minor formatting choices |

Routinize the right column. Invest in the left column.
