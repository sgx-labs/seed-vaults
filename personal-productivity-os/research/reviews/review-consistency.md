# How to Make Reviews Stick

## The Consistency Problem

Everyone agrees reviews are valuable. Almost no one does them consistently. The gap between knowing and doing is where productivity systems die.

## Why Reviews Get Skipped

1. **Too long**: A 90-minute review feels like a chore. Start with 15 minutes.
2. **Too vague**: "Do a review" is not actionable. Use a template with specific steps.
3. **No fixed time**: Reviews that are not scheduled do not happen.
4. **No immediate payoff**: The value of reviews compounds over weeks and months. The first few feel pointless.
5. **Perfectionism**: Waiting for the "right" time or the "right" mood. Just do it.

## Strategies That Work

### 1. Make It Tiny
A 15-minute review beats a skipped 60-minute review. Start small. Expand only after the habit is established.

See: `research/reviews/weekly-review-15min.md`

### 2. Anchor It to an Existing Routine
Attach your review to something you already do every week:
- "After my Friday team meeting, I do my review"
- "Sunday evening after dinner"
- "Monday morning before opening email"

### 3. Use a Template
Do not reinvent the review each time. Open the template, fill it in, done. Thinking about what to review is harder than reviewing.

Templates: `templates/weekly-review.md`, `templates/monthly-review.md`

### 4. Track the Streak
Mark each completed review on a calendar. The visual streak becomes motivating. Breaking a 10-week streak feels worse than skipping a one-off.

### 5. Reduce Friction
- Keep the template accessible (pinned note, bookmark, shortcut)
- Pre-load the context (have your project list and goals open)
- Do it in the same place each time

### 6. Allow Bad Reviews
A review where you rush through and only write "busy week, no progress on goals" is infinitely more useful than no review. It still resets your awareness. Lower the bar.

## The Compounding Effect

Reviews in isolation feel like overhead. Over months, they create:
- A record of what you accomplished (fights imposter syndrome)
- Pattern data on your productivity (enables optimization)
- Decision context (prevents re-litigation)
- Goal accountability (prevents drift)

The person who does 50 okay weekly reviews per year outperforms the person who does 5 perfect ones.

## Recovery Protocol

Skipped a few weeks? Do not try to "catch up." That guarantees you will skip more. Instead:
1. Open the weekly review template now.
2. Fill in what you can from memory.
3. Set priorities for next week.
4. Schedule the next review.
5. Move forward. No guilt.
