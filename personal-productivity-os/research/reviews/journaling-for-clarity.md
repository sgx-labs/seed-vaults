# Journaling for Clarity

## Why Journal

Journaling is not about recording events — it is about processing them. Writing forces you to organize scattered thoughts into coherent narratives. What felt overwhelming in your head often shrinks to manageable size on paper.

## Types of Journaling

### 1. Morning Pages (Stream of Consciousness)
Write 1-3 pages first thing in the morning. No structure, no editing. Just write whatever comes to mind. This clears mental clutter and often surfaces buried concerns or ideas.

**Time**: 10-20 minutes
**Best for**: Clearing the mind, discovering what you are actually thinking

### 2. Structured Reflection
Answer specific prompts at the end of the day or week. More focused than morning pages. Good for tracking progress and making decisions.

Common prompts:
- What went well today and why?
- What did I struggle with and what would I do differently?
- What am I grateful for?
- What is my intention for tomorrow?

**Time**: 5-10 minutes
**Best for**: Daily reflection, habit building

### 3. Decision Journaling
Write out the decision you are facing, the options, your thinking, and your emotions about each option. The act of writing often reveals what you actually want. Review past decision journals to learn your patterns.

**Time**: 15-30 minutes per decision
**Best for**: Big decisions, reducing decision anxiety

### 4. Weekly/Monthly Reflection
Built into the review frameworks. See `templates/weekly-review.md` and `templates/monthly-review.md`.

## How to Start

1. Pick one type. Do not try all four.
2. Set a minimal time commitment: 5 minutes per day.
3. Same time, same place, every day.
4. Do not reread immediately — review after 30 days for patterns.

## What Journaling Is Not

- Not a diary of events ("I went to the meeting, then had lunch")
- Not a performance review ("I should have been more productive")
- Not something anyone else reads
- Not something that needs to be good writing

## The Compound Effect

Individual journal entries feel insignificant. Over months, patterns emerge that you cannot see day-to-day: what triggers your best work, what consistently drains you, which decisions you keep getting right, which ones you keep regretting.

These patterns are gold for your monthly and quarterly reviews.
