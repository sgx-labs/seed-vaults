# A Weekly Review That Takes 15 Minutes

## Why Most People Skip Weekly Reviews

Two reasons: they take too long, and they feel like homework. A 90-minute weekly review is great in theory and abandoned by week three. The goal here is a review so short you have no excuse to skip it.

## The 15-Minute Framework

### Minutes 1-3: Clear the Inbox
Process any unprocessed captures from the week. For each item:
- Actionable? Add next action to your list.
- Reference? File it.
- Irrelevant? Delete it.

Do not get pulled into doing tasks here — just sort them.

### Minutes 4-7: Review Active Projects
Open `current-state/projects.md` and go through each active project:
- Is the next action still correct?
- Has anything changed?
- Is anything blocked?
- Update the status.

If a project has had no progress for two weeks, ask: is this still active, or should it move to someday/maybe?

### Minutes 8-10: Check the Calendar
Look at the coming week:
- What commitments do you have?
- Is there enough unscheduled time for deep work?
- Anything you need to prepare for?

### Minutes 11-13: Set Next Week's Priorities
Pick your top 3 priorities for next week. Write them down. These are the three things that, if you accomplish nothing else, would make the week a success.

1.
2.
3.

### Minutes 14-15: Quick Wins Log
Write down 2-3 wins from this week. Things you completed, problems you solved, progress you made. This takes 60 seconds and provides an outsized morale boost when you look back over months of reviews.

## When to Do It

Pick a consistent time. Common choices:
- Friday afternoon (close out the work week)
- Sunday evening (prepare for Monday)
- Monday morning (start the week with clarity)

The time matters less than consistency. Put it on your calendar.

## Scaling Up

If 15 minutes is not enough, add these one at a time:
- **Goal check** (5 min): Review `current-state/goals.md` — is this week's work serving your goals?
- **Energy check** (3 min): Rate your energy this week, identify what drained/energized you.
- **Decision review** (5 min): Any decisions made this week worth logging?

## The Streak Mindset

Missing one week is fine. Missing two weeks means your system is drifting. Three weeks and you effectively have no system. Prioritize the streak. A mediocre review done consistently beats a perfect review done occasionally.
