# Monthly Review Framework

## Purpose

Weekly reviews manage the trees. Monthly reviews manage the forest. The monthly review is where you zoom out, notice patterns, and adjust your direction before drifting too far off course.

## When to Do It

Last day of the month or first day of the new month. Block 45-60 minutes. Treat it as non-negotiable.

## The Framework

### 1. Read Your Weekly Reviews (10 min)
Skim the weekly reviews from the past month. Look for:
- Recurring themes (what keeps showing up?)
- Wins (what went well across the month?)
- Persistent blockers (what never got resolved?)
- Energy patterns (when were you energized vs. drained?)

### 2. Goal Progress (10 min)
Open `current-state/goals.md`. For each quarterly goal:
- What progress was made this month?
- Is the pace sufficient to hit the quarterly target?
- If behind: what needs to change? More time? Different approach? Lower the target?

### 3. Project Review (10 min)
Open `current-state/projects.md`. For each project:
- Status update: where is it now vs. where you expected?
- Any projects to complete, archive, or drop?
- Any new projects that should be added?

### 4. Pattern Recognition (10 min)
This is the most valuable part. Look for patterns:
- What type of work consistently gets delayed?
- What consistently energizes you?
- Where do you keep making the same mistake?
- What commitments do you regret taking on?

Write these down. Patterns become insights over time.

### 5. Adjust for Next Month (10 min)
Based on everything above:
- **Start**: What should you begin doing next month?
- **Stop**: What should you stop doing or deprioritize?
- **Continue**: What is working and should continue?
- Update priorities in `current-state/projects.md`

### 6. One-Sentence Summary (2 min)
Write a single sentence capturing the month. Over time, these create a timeline of your year that is surprisingly powerful to review.

## Common Mistakes

- **Skipping the pattern recognition step**: This is where the real value is. Without it, the review is just bookkeeping.
- **Not adjusting**: If the review does not change anything, it is not working.
- **Being too hard on yourself**: The review is for learning, not self-punishment. Note what went wrong, then focus on what to do differently.
