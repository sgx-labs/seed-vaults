# Personal Retrospectives — Agile Retros for One

## Why Run Retros on Yourself

Teams run retrospectives to improve how they work together. The same practice works for individuals. A personal retro creates a structured pause to ask: what is working, what is not, and what should I try next?

Without regular retros, you repeat the same mistakes, keep doing things that do not work, and miss opportunities to double down on what does.

## Four Frameworks (Pick One)

### 1. Start / Stop / Continue

The simplest format. Three questions.

- **Start:** What should I begin doing that I am not doing now?
- **Stop:** What should I quit because it is not working or not worth the time?
- **Continue:** What is working well and should keep going?

**Best for:** Weekly retros when you want something fast (10 minutes).

**Example output:**
- Start: Writing tomorrow's top priority before closing the laptop
- Stop: Checking email before 10am (it derails mornings)
- Continue: The Monday planning block — it has been working for 3 weeks

### 2. What Went Well / What Didn't / What to Try Next

A learning-focused format that emphasizes experimentation.

- **Went well:** Wins, progress, things that clicked
- **Didn't go well:** Friction, mistakes, energy drains
- **Try next:** One experiment based on what you learned

**Best for:** Bi-weekly retros when you are actively iterating on your system.

### 3. Mad / Sad / Glad

An emotion-focused format that surfaces how you feel about your work, not just what you accomplished.

- **Mad:** What frustrated you? What felt unfair or broken?
- **Sad:** What disappointed you? What did you miss or lose?
- **Glad:** What made you happy? What are you grateful for?

**Best for:** When you feel stuck, burned out, or disconnected. This format bypasses the analytical brain and surfaces emotional data that other formats miss.

### 4. 4Ls — Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed For

A comprehensive format that captures both positive and negative, concrete and aspirational.

- **Liked:** What did you enjoy? What felt good?
- **Learned:** What new insight or skill did you gain?
- **Lacked:** What was missing? What resource, knowledge, or support did you need?
- **Longed For:** What do you wish you had? What would make next month better?

**Best for:** Monthly retros where you want a full picture.

## How to Pick the Right Format

| Cadence | Recommended Format | Time |
|---------|-------------------|------|
| Weekly | Start / Stop / Continue | 10 min |
| Bi-weekly | What Went Well / Didn't / Try Next | 15 min |
| Monthly | 4Ls | 20 min |
| When feeling stuck | Mad / Sad / Glad | 15 min |

You do not need to use the same format every time. Match the format to what you need right now.

## Running the Retro

1. **Set a timer.** 10-20 minutes. A retro that runs too long becomes a venting session.
2. **Write, do not just think.** Thinking feels like reflection. Writing is reflection.
3. **Be specific.** "Things were stressful" is not useful. "The Wednesday deadline created two late nights because I underestimated the scope" is useful.
4. **Pick one action.** Not five. One concrete change for the next period.
5. **Compare to last retro.** Did you follow through on the action from last time? What happened?

## Common Mistakes

- **Skipping the retro when things are going well.** Good weeks have lessons too. What made it good? Can you replicate that?
- **Too many action items.** One change per retro. If you try to fix everything at once, you fix nothing.
- **No follow-up.** A retro without reviewing last retro's action item is just journaling. The power is in the feedback loop.
- **Only focusing on what went wrong.** "Continue" and "Glad" and "Liked" matter. Reinforcing what works is as important as fixing what does not.

## How SAME Helps

- The agent can run the retro conversationally: "What should you start, stop, and continue?" — then log the findings as a note.
- **`search_notes`** retrieves past retros so you can compare themes over time. If "too many meetings" shows up three months in a row, that is a pattern, not an incident.
- **Decision log** captures the one action item from each retro and its outcome.
- **`recent_activity`** shows what you actually worked on — useful reality-check data during the retro.
