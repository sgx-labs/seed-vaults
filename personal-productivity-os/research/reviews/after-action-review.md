# After-Action Review — Learning From Completed Projects

## What It Is

An after-action review (AAR) is a structured reflection after completing a project, event, or significant effort. It captures what happened, what worked, what did not, and what to do differently next time. Unlike a post-mortem (which implies failure), an AAR works for successes too.

## When to Do It

- After completing a project
- After a significant milestone
- After an event you organized
- After a failed initiative (especially then)
- After any experience you want to learn from

Do it within 48 hours while the experience is fresh.

## The Four Questions

### 1. What was supposed to happen?
State the original plan, goals, and success criteria. What did you set out to do?

### 2. What actually happened?
Describe the actual outcome, timeline, and results. Be factual, not judgmental. What did you deliver? How long did it take? What was the actual impact?

### 3. Why was there a difference?
Analyze the gap between plan and reality. What went better than expected and why? What went worse and why? Look for root causes, not symptoms.

### 4. What will you do differently?
Specific, actionable lessons. Not "try harder" or "plan better." Instead: "Define scope before starting implementation" or "Check in with stakeholders every two weeks, not every four."

## Making It Useful

The value of an AAR is not in writing it — it is in applying the lessons. Three ways to ensure lessons stick:

1. **Update your processes**: If you learned that weekly check-ins prevent scope creep, add that to your project kickoff template.
2. **Share the learning**: Tell someone else what you learned. Teaching reinforces retention.
3. **Review past AARs before starting new projects**: The agent can surface relevant lessons when you start a new project.

## Common Mistakes

- **Blame-focused**: Focus on systems and processes, not individuals.
- **Too vague**: "Communication was bad" is not useful. "We did not have a shared channel and updates got lost" is actionable.
- **Never referenced again**: If you write AARs but never review them, stop writing them. The value is in the feedback loop.
