# The Energy Audit — Mapping Your Day

## Purpose

Most people schedule based on availability, not energy. The energy audit maps your natural rhythms so you can match high-energy hours to your most important work and low-energy hours to routine tasks.

## How to Run an Energy Audit

### Step 1: Track for 5 Days
Set a reminder to check in with yourself every 2 hours throughout the workday. Rate your:
- **Mental energy** (1-5): How sharp is your thinking?
- **Physical energy** (1-5): How does your body feel?
- **Motivation** (1-5): How engaged are you with work?

Note what you were doing at each check-in.

### Step 2: Plot the Pattern
After 5 days, look for patterns:

| Time | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Average |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| 8am  |     |     |     |     |     |         |
| 10am |     |     |     |     |     |         |
| 12pm |     |     |     |     |     |         |
| 2pm  |     |     |     |     |     |         |
| 4pm  |     |     |     |     |     |         |

Most people find:
- A peak in the late morning (9-11am)
- A trough after lunch (1-3pm)
- A moderate recovery in the late afternoon (3-5pm)

Your pattern may differ. The point is to know yours.

### Step 3: Redesign Your Schedule

Map your energy to your work:

| Energy Level | Best Activities |
|-------------|----------------|
| Peak | Deep work, creative tasks, hard decisions, strategic thinking |
| Medium | Collaboration, meetings, planning, communication |
| Low | Email, admin, filing, routine tasks, recovery |

### Step 4: Protect Your Peak

Block your peak hours for deep work. Non-negotiable. Do not let meetings or email encroach. This single change — matching peak energy to important work — often produces more impact than any productivity technique.

## Factors That Affect Energy

- **Sleep**: The single biggest factor. Everything else is noise if you are not sleeping enough.
- **Food**: Heavy meals cause energy crashes. Lighter lunches preserve afternoon focus.
- **Exercise**: Regular exercise increases baseline energy. Even a short walk helps.
- **Caffeine**: Useful but manage timing. Caffeine after 2pm disrupts sleep for most people.
- **Social interaction**: Energizing for some, draining for others. Know which you are.

## Repeat Quarterly

Your energy patterns change with seasons, workload, health, and life circumstances. Re-run the audit every quarter to keep your schedule aligned with your actual energy.

## Update Your Profile

After the audit, update `entities/me.md` with your energy patterns so the agent can help you schedule effectively.
