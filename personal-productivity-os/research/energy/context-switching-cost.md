# The True Cost of Context Switching

## The Problem

Every time you switch from one task to another, your brain pays a switching cost. Research consistently finds that it takes 10-25 minutes to fully re-engage with a complex task after an interruption. This is not about willpower — it is about how attention works.

## The Math

Consider a typical day with 4 context switches:

| Block | Task | Switch Cost | Effective Work |
|-------|------|-------------|----------------|
| 9:00-10:30 | Deep work | — | 90 min |
| 10:30-10:45 | Check email (switch) | 15 min recovery | — |
| 10:45-12:00 | Meeting | — | 75 min |
| 12:00-12:15 | Slack messages (switch) | 15 min recovery | — |
| 1:00-2:30 | Different project | 15 min recovery | 75 min |
| 2:30-2:45 | Quick question from colleague | 15 min recovery | — |
| 2:45-4:00 | Back to original project | 15 min recovery | 60 min |

Total switching cost: 60+ minutes of productive time lost to transitions. On a bad day with frequent interruptions, this can exceed 2-3 hours.

## Types of Context Switches

### 1. Task Switching
Moving between unrelated tasks. The most costly. Each task loads a different mental model, and the old one lingers (attention residue).

### 2. Interruptions
Someone asks a question, a notification pops up, the phone rings. Even brief interruptions impose the full switching cost.

### 3. Self-Interruption
Checking email, opening a new tab, pulling out your phone. Research shows people self-interrupt as often as they are externally interrupted.

## Reducing Switching Costs

### Batch Similar Work
Group related tasks together. All email in one block. All meetings back-to-back. All creative work in one stretch.

### Protect Transition-Free Blocks
Schedule blocks where you do not switch at all. Longer blocks are disproportionately valuable: a 3-hour block is worth more than three 1-hour blocks because of zero switching overhead.

### Reduce Notifications
Turn off everything except critical alerts. Check things on your schedule, not when they beep.

### Theme Your Days
If possible, dedicate certain days to certain types of work:
- Monday/Thursday: deep project work
- Tuesday/Friday: meetings and collaboration
- Wednesday: admin, email, planning

### Create a "Parking Lot"
When a thought about a different task intrudes during deep work, write it down and return to your current task. Do not follow the thought. Process the parking lot during a transition.

## For the Weekly Review

Add this question: "How many context switches did I have this week in a typical day? What caused them? Can I reduce any?"
