# Burnout Detection and Prevention

## What Burnout Is

Burnout is not being tired from hard work. It is a state of chronic depletion caused by sustained stress without adequate recovery. It manifests as physical exhaustion, emotional detachment (cynicism), and reduced effectiveness — often all three at once.

## The Three Dimensions

### 1. Exhaustion
Physical and emotional depletion. You feel drained even after rest. Work feels like wading through mud.

### 2. Cynicism
Detachment from your work. You stop caring about outcomes. Things that used to excite you feel pointless. You become irritable.

### 3. Reduced Effectiveness
You are working the same hours but producing less. Quality drops. Simple tasks feel hard. You make mistakes you would not normally make.

All three together is burnout. One or two may be stress or fatigue, which are recoverable with a break.

## Early Warning Signs

| Stage | Signs | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Green | Occasional stress, generally engaged | Maintain: sleep, exercise, recovery days |
| Yellow | Persistent fatigue, growing cynicism, dreading work | Reduce: cut commitments, take a long weekend, talk to someone |
| Orange | Can't concentrate, physical symptoms, emotional numbness | Urgent: significant workload reduction, possible time off |
| Red | Can't function, health impacts, considering quitting everything | Stop: take leave, see a professional, do not make big decisions |

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Build Recovery Into the System
Recovery is not a reward for finishing work. It is a prerequisite for doing good work. Schedule it:
- Daily: at least one activity that recharges you (exercise, hobby, nature, socializing)
- Weekly: one full day with no work
- Quarterly: a multi-day break

### 2. Set Boundaries on Work Hours
Decide when work ends and enforce it. "I work until the work is done" is a recipe for burnout. "I work until 6pm and then I stop" is a boundary.

### 3. Reduce Commitments
Burnout is often caused by too many simultaneous obligations. Audit your commitments. What can be dropped, delegated, deferred, or done less frequently?

See: `research/goals/saying-no.md`

### 4. Seek Control
Burnout correlates strongly with lack of autonomy. If you feel like you have no control over your work, address that. Talk to your manager. Change your approach. If the situation cannot change, consider whether the role is right for you.

### 5. Reconnect to Meaning
Why does your work matter? Sometimes burnout is not about workload but about lost connection to purpose. Revisit your goals in `current-state/goals.md`. Are you working on what matters to you?

### 6. Monitor in Weekly Reviews
Add the energy check to your weekly review:
- Energy level this week (1-10)?
- What drained me?
- What energized me?
- Am I trending up or down over the past month?

Trending downward for 3+ weeks is a signal to act.

## Recovery

If you are already burned out:
1. Reduce workload immediately (not gradually)
2. Take time off if possible
3. Do not make major life decisions while burned out
4. Rebuild slowly — half capacity for at least 2-4 weeks
5. Address the root cause, or it will recur

Burnout is not a character flaw. It is a signal that the system needs adjustment.
