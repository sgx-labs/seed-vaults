# Weekly Planning — From Review to Action

## The Gap Between Reviewing and Doing

The weekly review tells you what is happening. Weekly planning tells you what to do about it. They work best as a pair: review first (what is the current state), then plan (what will I do this week).

## The Planning Process (10 Minutes)

Do this immediately after your weekly review, or as the final step of the review itself.

### Step 1: Identify the Week's Constraints
Look at your calendar for the coming week:
- How many hours are already committed (meetings, appointments)?
- How many hours are available for focused work?
- Any deadlines this week?
- Any travel, events, or disruptions?

Be realistic. If you have 6 hours of meetings on Tuesday, you are not doing deep work on Tuesday.

### Step 2: Pick 3 Priorities
From your project list and goal check, what are the 3 most important things to accomplish this week?

Write them down. These are your "Big 3":
1.
2.
3.

Rule: If you accomplish these three things and nothing else, the week was a success.

### Step 3: Schedule the Big 3
Block time on your calendar for each priority. Match them to your energy peaks:
- Biggest, hardest priority → your best focus slot
- Second priority → your second-best slot
- Third priority → wherever it fits

### Step 4: Define Next Actions
For each priority, write the very next physical action:
- Priority 1 → "Open the draft document and write the introduction section"
- Priority 2 → "Review the three proposals and write comparison notes"
- Priority 3 → "Send the kickoff message to the project channel"

### Step 5: Identify the One Thing to Avoid
What is one time-waster or distraction to avoid this week? Name it explicitly:
- "Don't check email before 10am"
- "Say no to any new commitments this week"
- "Don't attend meetings without agendas"

## Weekday Quick Planning

Each morning, take 2 minutes to answer:
1. What are today's top 1-2 priorities?
2. What is already scheduled?
3. What is the first thing I will work on?

This bridges the gap between weekly planning and daily execution.

## When Plans Break

They will. The point of planning is not to predict the week perfectly — it is to enter the week with intention. When plans break:
1. Reassess your Big 3: are they still the right priorities?
2. If yes, reschedule them. Do not let them quietly disappear.
3. If no, pick new priorities based on what changed.
