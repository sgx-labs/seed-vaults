# The Eisenhower Matrix — Urgent vs Important

## The Framework

Every task can be classified along two dimensions: urgency (time pressure) and importance (impact on your goals). This creates four quadrants.

| | **Urgent** | **Not Urgent** |
|---|---|---|
| **Important** | Q1: DO — Crisis, deadlines, emergencies | Q2: SCHEDULE — Planning, learning, relationships, prevention |
| **Not Important** | Q3: DELEGATE — Interruptions, most meetings, other people's priorities | Q4: DELETE — Busywork, time-wasters, avoidance activities |

## The Trap Most People Fall Into

Most people live in Q1 and Q3.

**Q1 (Do)** feels productive because the urgency creates adrenaline. But spending all your time here means you are always firefighting. You never prevent fires because prevention is Q2 work.

**Q3 (Delegate)** feels productive because you are responding to other people's requests. But their urgency is not your importance. That "quick question" from a colleague, the meeting you did not need to attend, the notification you had to check — all Q3.

The result: exhaustion with no progress on what actually matters.

## Where You Should Spend Your Time

**Q2 (Schedule)** is where the highest-leverage work lives.

- Strategic planning
- Learning and skill development
- Relationship building
- Exercise and health
- Systems design
- Preventing future problems

Q2 work never screams for attention. It is easy to postpone because nothing bad happens today if you skip it. But everything bad happens eventually if you always skip it.

**The goal is not to eliminate Q1.** Emergencies happen. The goal is to shrink Q1 by investing in Q2. Prevention reduces the number of crises.

## How to Use It Daily

### At the start of each session:

1. List everything on your plate.
2. For each item, ask two questions:
   - Is this urgent? (Will something bad happen if I do not do it today?)
   - Is this important? (Does this move my goals or responsibilities forward?)
3. Sort into quadrants.
4. Work Q1 first (you have to), then Q2 (you should), then Q3 (delegate or batch), then Q4 (eliminate).

### Decision Rules

| Quadrant | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Q1 | Do it now. But ask: could this have been prevented with Q2 work? |
| Q2 | Schedule a protected block. This is your most valuable work. |
| Q3 | Can someone else handle this? Can it wait? Can you batch it? |
| Q4 | Delete it. If it is not urgent and not important, why are you doing it? |

## The Subtle Mistakes

**Mistaking urgency for importance.** A ringing phone is urgent. That does not make the call important. Train yourself to pause before reacting.

**Ignoring Q2 because it is "not urgent."** By definition, Q2 never screams. You have to deliberately protect time for it.

**Guilt about Q4.** Some Q4 activities are rest and recovery, which are actually Q2 (important for long-term performance). Scrolling social media for 2 hours is Q4. A 20-minute walk to recharge is Q2.

## Actionable Steps

1. Take your current task list and sort each item into a quadrant.
2. Identify how much of your last week was spent in Q3 and Q4. Be honest.
3. Block one hour this week for Q2 work. Protect it like a meeting with your most important client.
4. For every Q1 task, ask: "What Q2 action would have prevented this?"
5. Practice saying no to Q3 requests. Start with one per week.

## How SAME Helps

- The agent can ask "Is this urgent, important, or both?" when you add new tasks, helping you categorize in real time.
- **`search_notes`** on "priorities" or "important" surfaces your stated goals — a reality check when urgency is pulling you off course.
- **Session handoffs** capture what you actually worked on, making it visible when Q3 and Q4 are consuming your days.
- **Decision log** records when you chose Q2 over Q3, reinforcing the habit.
