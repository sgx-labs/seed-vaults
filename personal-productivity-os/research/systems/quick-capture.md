# Quick Capture — Getting Ideas Out of Your Head

## Why Capture Matters

Ideas, tasks, and commitments that stay in your head do two bad things: they create anxiety (your brain keeps pinging you about them) and they get lost (your brain is unreliable storage). Fast capture solves both.

## The Capture Habit

### Rule 1: Capture Everything
If something occurs to you and it is not the thing you are doing right now, capture it. Do not evaluate, organize, or prioritize in the moment. Just get it out of your head.

### Rule 2: Make It Frictionless
The capture tool must be faster than the thought. If it takes more than 5 seconds to start capturing, you will not do it consistently. Options:
- Voice note on your phone
- Quick-entry shortcut in your notes app
- A physical notebook you always carry
- A pinned note or scratch file on your desktop
- Tell your AI agent: "Remember this: ..."

### Rule 3: One Inbox
All captures go to one place. Not scattered across apps, sticky notes, and email drafts. One inbox that you process regularly.

### Rule 4: Process, Don't Hoard
Capture is not the end — it is the beginning. Process your inbox at least once per day. For each item:
- Actionable? Define the next action and put it in your system.
- Reference? File it.
- Nothing? Delete it.

## Capture Prompts

When you catch yourself thinking any of these, capture immediately:
- "I should..."
- "I need to remember to..."
- "That reminds me..."
- "What if we..."
- "Don't forget..."
- "I wonder whether..."

## The 2-Minute Rule Connection

If something takes less than 2 minutes to do, do it immediately instead of capturing it. The overhead of capturing, filing, and reviewing a 2-minute task exceeds the cost of just doing it.

## Common Capture Failures

1. **Multiple inboxes**: Notes in 5 apps, sticky notes on the desk, emails starred. Consolidate.
2. **Capturing but never processing**: Your inbox grows until you stop trusting it.
3. **Too much friction**: If the tool is slow to open, you will stop using it.
4. **Editing while capturing**: Do not wordsmith. Just dump. Organize later.
