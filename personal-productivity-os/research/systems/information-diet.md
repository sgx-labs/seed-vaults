# Information Diet — Reducing Noise

## The Problem

Most knowledge workers consume far more information than they can act on. News, social media, newsletters, Slack channels, podcasts, articles — the input stream never stops. This creates an illusion of productivity ("I'm staying informed") while draining the energy needed for actual work.

## The Information Audit

Before changing anything, audit your current inputs:

| Source | Time/Day | Value (1-5) | Actionable? |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Email | | | |
| Slack/Teams | | | |
| News sites | | | |
| Social media | | | |
| Newsletters | | | |
| Podcasts | | | |
| RSS/feeds | | | |

Be honest. Most information consumption is habit, not necessity.

## Principles

### 1. Pull, Don't Push
Seek information when you need it, instead of letting it push to you. Turn off non-essential notifications. Check things on your schedule, not when they beep.

### 2. Batch Consumption
Process email 2-3 times per day, not continuously. Read newsletters in one sitting. Check news once, not six times.

### 3. Apply the "Will I Act on This?" Test
For every information source, ask: "Does this lead to action or just awareness?" Awareness feels productive but often is not.

### 4. Unsubscribe Aggressively
If you have not read the last 3 issues of a newsletter, unsubscribe. If a Slack channel is all noise, leave it. Reduce inputs to what you actually use.

### 5. Protect the First Hour
Do not start your day with email or news. Start with your most important work. Information consumption expands to fill whatever time you give it.

## The 30-Day Challenge

For 30 days:
1. No news first thing in the morning
2. Email checked only at designated times (e.g., 10am, 2pm, 5pm)
3. Social media limited to one 15-minute window
4. Unsubscribe from one newsletter per day until only essential ones remain

Track how your focus and energy change.

## What to Keep

Not all information is noise. Keep inputs that:
- Directly support your active projects
- Help you make decisions you face right now
- Provide genuine learning in your field
- Bring you joy (some consumption is leisure, and that is fine)

The goal is not zero input — it is intentional input.
