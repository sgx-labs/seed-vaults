# GTD Essentials — What Actually Matters

## The Core Problem GTD Solves

Your brain is terrible at tracking open loops. Every uncommitted task, half-formed idea, and unresolved question occupies mental RAM. GTD's core insight: externalize all of it into a trusted system so your mind can focus on doing, not remembering.

## The Five Steps (Distilled)

### 1. Capture
Get everything out of your head. Every task, idea, "I should," and "don't forget" goes into an inbox. The capture tool does not matter — what matters is that you use one and trust it.

**Key principle**: The inbox is not a to-do list. It is a holding pen.

### 2. Clarify
Process each item in the inbox. For each one, ask:
- Is it actionable? If no, trash it, file it as reference, or add to someday/maybe.
- If yes, what is the very next physical action?
- Will it take less than 2 minutes? Do it now. (See: `research/systems/two-minute-rule.md`)
- Is it a multi-step outcome? It is a project. Add it to your project list.

### 3. Organize
Put clarified items where they belong:
- **Next actions**: Things you can do right now, sorted by context
- **Projects**: Outcomes requiring multiple steps (each needs a next action)
- **Waiting for**: Delegated items or things blocked on others
- **Calendar**: Date-specific commitments only
- **Reference**: Useful information, not actionable

### 4. Reflect
Weekly review. This is the step most people skip, and it is the step that makes the entire system trustworthy. Without regular review, your lists become stale and your trust erodes.

See: `research/reviews/weekly-review-15min.md`

### 5. Engage
Do the work. With a clean, reviewed system, you can choose what to do based on context, energy, time available, and priority — instead of whatever screams loudest.

## Common GTD Mistakes

1. **Over-engineering the system**: You need capture, a project list, next actions, and a weekly review. Everything else is optional.
2. **Not defining next actions**: "Work on presentation" is not an action. "Draft slide 1 outline" is.
3. **Skipping the weekly review**: The system rots without it.
4. **Using your inbox as a task list**: Process it to zero, then work from your action lists.
5. **Too many contexts**: Start with 3-4 contexts max. Add more only if needed.

## The Minimum Viable GTD

If the full system feels heavy, start here:
1. One capture tool (notes app, paper, voice memo)
2. One project list with next actions
3. Weekly review (15 minutes)

That is it. Add complexity only when simplicity is not working.
