# The Minimum Viable Productivity System

## The Problem

Complex productivity systems get abandoned. The Notion dashboard with 12 linked databases. The elaborate Roam graph. The color-coded bullet journal. They are beautiful and useless within three weeks.

## The Minimum Viable System

You need exactly three things:

### 1. A Capture Tool
One place to dump thoughts, tasks, and ideas as they occur. Must be fast to access (under 5 seconds). A notes app, a text file, a paper notebook — anything works.

### 2. A Project List With Next Actions
A list of your active projects (3-5 max), each with one defined next action. Review this daily to decide what to work on.

```
PROJECT: Launch new feature
  Next action: Write the API specification document

PROJECT: Hire a designer
  Next action: Review the 3 portfolio links from last week

PROJECT: Q2 planning
  Next action: Block 2 hours on Thursday for planning session
```

### 3. A Weekly Review (15 Minutes)
Once per week, process your captures, update your project list, and set priorities for the next week.

## What You Do NOT Need

- A complex tagging system
- Multiple databases or views
- Automated workflows
- A specific app or tool
- Color coding
- Priority matrices
- Time tracking (unless required for billing)

## When to Add Complexity

Add one element at a time, only when the current system is not handling something:

| Problem | Add This |
|---------|----------|
| Missing deadlines | Calendar for date-specific items |
| Losing track of delegated tasks | Waiting-for list |
| Can't find information | Reference filing system |
| Projects lack direction | Goal tracking (quarterly) |
| Burning out | Energy audit in weekly review |

## The Litmus Test

After any productivity change, ask: "Am I doing more of what matters, or am I spending more time managing my system?" If the answer is the latter, simplify.

## Starting From Zero

If you have no system at all:
1. Write down everything on your mind right now (brain dump)
2. For each item: define the next action or delete it
3. Group multi-step items into projects
4. Pick the top 3 priorities for this week
5. Schedule 15 minutes on Friday for your first weekly review

You now have a complete productivity system.
