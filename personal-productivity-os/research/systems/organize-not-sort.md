# Organize, Don't Sort — Next Actions Over Task Lists

## The Problem With Task Lists

Most people's to-do lists are graveyards of vague intentions:
- "Work on presentation"
- "Follow up with team"
- "Think about strategy"
- "Fix that thing"

These are not actionable. They require a decision before you can act on them — and that decision cost is why they sit on the list for weeks.

## The Next Action Principle

For every item on your list, define the very next physical, visible action:

| Vague | Next Action |
|-------|-------------|
| "Work on presentation" | "Draft the 3 key slides for the Q2 update" |
| "Follow up with team" | "Send status check message to the project channel" |
| "Think about strategy" | "Write 3 possible approaches for the product launch" |
| "Fix that thing" | "Reproduce the login bug in the staging environment" |

## Why This Works

1. **Removes the decision barrier**: When you look at your list, you know exactly what to do. No thinking required.
2. **Makes progress visible**: Completing a next action always creates a new next action. You can see the chain of progress.
3. **Reveals stuck projects**: If you cannot define a next action, you have an unresolved question — surface it and resolve it.
4. **Matches available energy**: Small, clear actions are easier to start when your energy is low.

## Projects vs. Actions

A **project** is any outcome requiring more than one action. "Redesign the onboarding flow" is a project. It needs to be broken into next actions.

Every active project must have exactly one defined next action at all times. If a project has no next action, it is stalled — and you may not notice unless you review it.

## The Organizing Step

When processing your inbox:
1. **Is it actionable?** If no: trash, reference, or someday/maybe.
2. **Is it a single action?** Do it (if under 2 minutes), delegate it, or schedule it.
3. **Is it a multi-step outcome?** It is a project. Add it to your project list. Define the next action.

## Common Mistakes

- **Mixing projects and actions**: Keep them on separate lists.
- **Actions that are actually projects**: "Plan the offsite" is a project, not an action.
- **No next action defined**: If your project list has no next actions, you have a list of wishes, not a plan.
- **Never deleting**: If it has been on the list for 3 weeks with no progress, question whether it belongs there.
