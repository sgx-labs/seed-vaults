# Eat That Frog — Do the Hardest Thing First

## The Framework

Brian Tracy's premise is simple: if the first thing you do each morning is eat a live frog, nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.

Your "frog" is the task you are most likely to procrastinate on — usually because it is the most important and most demanding. Do it first. Everything else feels easier afterward.

## Why It Works

### Willpower Is Finite
Research on decision fatigue shows that self-control depletes throughout the day. Morning willpower is at its peak. By afternoon, you have spent it on dozens of small decisions. Tackling the hardest task when willpower is highest gives it your best cognitive resources.

### Momentum Is Real
Completing a difficult task early creates a psychological win that carries through the day. You feel capable. The remaining tasks feel smaller by comparison. This is the opposite of leaving the hard thing until 4pm, when it looms over everything and poisons the whole day.

### Procrastination Feeds on Delay
The longer you postpone the frog, the more mental energy it consumes. It sits in the back of your mind, creating low-grade anxiety. Every hour you delay, the task feels bigger and your motivation to start it shrinks.

## How to Identify Your Frog

Ask yourself:
1. If I could only complete one task today, which one would have the greatest positive impact?
2. Which task am I most tempted to put off?
3. Which task, if completed, would make everything else easier or unnecessary?

The intersection of "highest impact" and "most avoided" is your frog.

## The Daily Practice

1. **The night before or first thing in the morning**, identify your frog. Write it down.
2. **Start your work session with the frog.** Before email. Before messages. Before "quick wins."
3. **Work on it until it is done** or until you have made meaningful progress (at least 60-90 minutes).
4. **Then move to everything else.** The rest of the day is a victory lap.

## The ADHD Caveat

"Eat that frog" assumes everyone has the activation energy to start the hardest task cold. For many people — especially those with ADHD — this does not work. Starting the day with the most overwhelming task can lead to paralysis, not productivity.

### The Alternative: Eat a Tadpole First

If the frog is too big to start with, eat a tadpole:

1. **Start with a 2-5 minute easy win.** Reply to one email. Organize your desk. Complete one tiny task.
2. **Use that activation energy** to transition into the frog. The easy win warms up the engine.
3. **Then tackle the frog** while the momentum is fresh.

This is not procrastination — it is strategic warm-up. The key is that the warm-up task is short (under 5 minutes) and leads directly into the frog.

### Know Yourself

| If this describes you... | Do this |
|--------------------------|---------|
| Strong morning energy, can start hard tasks cold | Eat the frog first thing |
| Slow to start, need to warm up | Eat a tadpole, then the frog |
| Variable energy, some days strong, some days not | Check your energy first, then decide |
| High anxiety about the frog | Break the frog into tadpole-sized pieces, eat them one at a time |

## Common Mistakes

**Picking the wrong frog.** The frog is not the most urgent task — it is the most important one you are avoiding. Sometimes the real frog is a difficult conversation, not a spreadsheet.

**Checking email first "just to see."** Email is other people's priorities. Once you open it, your frog gets pushed back. Do the frog, then email.

**Multiple frogs.** You get one frog per day. If everything feels like a frog, your workload needs triage, not a productivity framework.

**Skipping the frog when it is "not a good day."** The frog is especially important on bad days. On good days, you would do it anyway.

## Actionable Steps

1. **Tonight**, write down tomorrow's frog. One task. The most important thing you are avoiding.
2. **Tomorrow morning**, start with the frog before opening any communication tools.
3. **Set a timer for 60 minutes** and work on nothing else.
4. **After 60 minutes**, assess: is it done? Can you keep going? Or do you need a break before finishing?
5. **Track for one week**: did you eat the frog each day? What happened on the days you did vs. did not?

## How SAME Helps

- A **morning-start recipe** can include "What is your frog today?" as the first prompt, ensuring the question gets asked every session.
- **`search_notes`** for "priorities" or "most important" surfaces your stated goals — helping you identify the real frog vs. the urgent distraction.
- **Session handoffs** from the previous day often reveal the frog: it is the thing that was "next" but did not get done.
- **Decision log** captures when you chose the frog over easier tasks, building a record of follow-through.
