# PARA Method — Organize by Actionability

## The Core Idea

Most people organize information by topic: "Marketing," "Finance," "Personal." This creates filing cabinets that grow forever and are impossible to maintain.

PARA organizes by actionability instead. Every piece of information goes into one of four categories based on how actionable it is right now.

## The Four Categories

### Projects
Short-term efforts with a clear goal and a deadline.

- "Launch the new onboarding flow by March 15"
- "Complete the certification exam by end of Q1"
- "Plan the team offsite for April"

A project has a finish line. When you cross it, the project moves to Archives.

### Areas
Ongoing responsibilities with a standard to maintain, but no end date.

- Health and fitness
- Financial management
- Team leadership
- Home maintenance
- Professional development

Areas never finish. You maintain them continuously. The question is not "is it done?" but "am I meeting my standard?"

### Resources
Topics of interest that are not tied to a current project or area responsibility.

- Productivity frameworks
- Design patterns
- Industry trends
- Book notes

Resources are reference material. They become relevant when a Project or Area needs them.

### Archives
Completed projects, inactive areas, and resources you no longer use.

Archives are not deleted. They are set aside. If a topic becomes active again, move it back.

## The Key Insight

**The category changes based on your life, not the content.**

"Cooking" might be a Resource (casual interest) for one person, an Area (responsible for family meals) for another, and a Project (preparing for a dinner party next Saturday) for a third.

When your relationship to a topic changes, move it. PARA is dynamic, not static.

## How PARA Maps to a SAME Vault

| PARA Category | Vault Location | Examples |
|---------------|---------------|----------|
| Projects | `current-state/` | Active work with deadlines |
| Areas | `entities/` | People, teams, responsibilities you maintain |
| Resources | `research/` | Frameworks, reference material, notes |
| Archives | `sessions/` | Completed sessions, past decisions |

The vault is already structured this way. The difference is making it intentional:
- Before creating a note, ask: is this a Project, Area, Resource, or Archive?
- During weekly review, check: has anything changed categories?

## Common Mistakes

**Too many Projects.** If you have more than 10 active projects, some of them are actually Areas or wishes. A real project has a specific outcome and a real deadline.

**Confusing Areas and Resources.** The test: are you responsible for maintaining a standard in this domain? If yes, it is an Area. If no, it is a Resource.

**Never archiving.** Completed projects and outdated resources should move to Archives. A lean active system is a usable system.

**Organizing by topic instead of actionability.** Having a "Marketing" folder with projects, reference material, and archived campaigns all mixed together defeats the purpose.

## Actionable Steps

1. List your current projects. Each must have a clear outcome and a deadline. If it does not, it is probably an Area.
2. List your areas of responsibility. These are the roles and standards you maintain.
3. Move everything else to Resources or Archives.
4. During your weekly review, scan each category: anything to move?
5. When creating a new note, pause for one second: Project, Area, Resource, or Archive?

## How SAME Helps

- **`search_notes`** works better when notes are in the right category — search for "active project" and get projects, not archived references.
- **Session handoffs** naturally create project state — what happened, what is next.
- **Decision log** captures when you move something between categories, preventing the "is this still active?" confusion.
- The vault structure itself mirrors PARA, so the agent can orient quickly: "What are your active projects?" maps to `current-state/`.
