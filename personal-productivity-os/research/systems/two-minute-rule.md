# The Two-Minute Rule — Do It or Defer It

## The Rule

If a task will take less than two minutes to complete, do it immediately. Do not add it to your list, schedule it, or think about it later. The overhead of tracking a two-minute task is greater than the cost of just doing it now.

## When It Applies

The two-minute rule works best during inbox processing (clarifying captured items) and during transitions between tasks. It is not an invitation to constantly interrupt deep work with small tasks.

Good times to apply it:
- Processing your daily capture
- Between meetings
- After completing a major task
- During weekly review when clearing small items

Bad times to apply it:
- During a deep work block
- When context-switching cost would exceed the task's value
- When "two minutes" is actually fifteen

## Examples

| Task | Time | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| Reply to a simple email | 1 min | Do it now |
| File a document | 30 sec | Do it now |
| Book a meeting room | 2 min | Do it now |
| Research a vendor option | 20 min | Defer — add to task list |
| Write a project brief | 45 min | Defer — schedule it |
| Quick Slack reply | 1 min | Do it now |

## The Anti-Pattern: Two-Minute Creep

Watch for tasks that seem like two minutes but always expand:
- "Quick email reply" that turns into a 10-email thread
- "Fast code fix" that uncovers a deeper bug
- "Simple question" that requires research

If you start a two-minute task and realize it is bigger, stop. Capture it as a proper task and move on.

## Combined With Batching

Some two-minute tasks are best batched: process all quick emails at once, file all documents at once. Batching reduces context-switching even for small items.

## The Bigger Principle

The two-minute rule is really about decision speed. For trivial tasks, the cost of deciding when to do them exceeds the cost of doing them. Apply the same logic more broadly: for reversible, low-stakes decisions, decide fast and move on.
