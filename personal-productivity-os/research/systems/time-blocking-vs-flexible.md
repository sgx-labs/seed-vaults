# Time Blocking vs. Flexible Scheduling

## Two Approaches to Your Day

### Time Blocking
Assign specific tasks to specific time blocks on your calendar. Your day is pre-planned. Every hour has a purpose.

**Best for:**
- People who thrive on structure
- Days with lots of deep work to protect
- Roles with predictable schedules
- When focus is the bottleneck

**Risks:**
- Plans shatter when interruptions happen
- Can feel rigid and stressful
- Requires regular re-planning
- Over-scheduling leads to guilt when you cannot keep up

### Flexible Scheduling
Maintain a prioritized list. Work on the highest-priority item that fits your current context, energy, and available time. No pre-assigned time slots.

**Best for:**
- Unpredictable, reactive roles
- People who resist rigid schedules
- Days heavy with meetings and interruptions
- When adaptability is the bottleneck

**Risks:**
- Easy to procrastinate on hard tasks
- Important-not-urgent work gets pushed indefinitely
- Without structure, the day can feel directionless
- Shallow work crowds out deep work

## The Hybrid Approach

Most people do best with a combination:

1. **Block your peak hours** for deep work (non-negotiable)
2. **Flexible schedule** for everything else
3. **Theme your days** if possible (meeting days vs. maker days)

Example:
```
Morning (peak energy):  Blocked — deep work, no meetings
Midday:                 Flexible — meetings, email, collaboration
Afternoon:              Flexible — priority tasks from list
End of day:             Blocked — wrap-up, capture, planning
```

## How to Choose

Ask yourself:
- Do I frequently lose full days to reactive work? → Block your focus time.
- Do I feel stressed when my plan breaks? → Go more flexible.
- Do I procrastinate on important work? → Block it.
- Does my role require constant availability? → Flexible with focus blocks.

## The Key Insight

The method matters less than the intent. Both approaches work when you are deliberate about protecting time for important work. Both fail when you let the urgent crowd out the important.
