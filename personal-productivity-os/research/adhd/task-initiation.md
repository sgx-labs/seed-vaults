# Task Initiation: Why Starting Is the Hardest Part

## The Activation Energy Problem

In chemistry, activation energy is the minimum energy needed to start a reaction. ADHD brains have a dramatically higher activation energy for tasks that are not intrinsically interesting, urgent, or novel.

This is not laziness. Brain imaging shows that the prefrontal cortex — the region responsible for initiating goal-directed behavior — is underactive in ADHD. The neural pathway between "I should do this" and "I am doing this" has a gap. For neurotypical brains, that gap is a crack. For ADHD brains, it is a canyon.

The result: you can sit next to the task for hours, knowing exactly what to do, feeling terrible about not doing it, and still not starting. The knowing-doing gap is the core challenge.

## Why Traditional Advice Fails

"Just start" is the least helpful advice for someone with a task initiation deficit. It assumes the ability to start is available and just needs willpower. It is like telling someone with poor eyesight to "just see better."

Other unhelpful advice:
- "Break it into smaller steps" — Helpful in theory, but you need activation energy to do the breaking too
- "Set a deadline" — ADHD brains do not respond to distant deadlines (see: time blindness)
- "Think about the consequences" — Consequences live in "not now," which does not feel real

## Strategies That Actually Work

### 1. The Two-Minute Start
Do not commit to the whole task. Commit to two minutes of it. Just open the document. Just write one sentence. Just put one dish in the sink.

Why this works: the activation energy for "two minutes" is dramatically lower than for "the whole thing." And once you start, momentum often carries you forward. The hardest step is always the first one.

### 2. Shrink the First Step Until It Is Absurd
If "write the report" feels impossible, try "open the file." If that feels impossible, try "sit in the chair where I write." Make the first step so small that refusing it feels silly.

The goal is not the micro-step. The goal is breaking the freeze. Once you are in motion, you are a different person than the one who was stuck.

### 3. Body Doubling
Body doubling means having another person present while you work — not helping, not supervising, just existing nearby and also working. This is one of the most effective ADHD strategies, and it works because:
- Social accountability activates a different motivational pathway
- The presence of others suppresses the self-interruption impulse
- You borrow activation energy from the shared context

Body doubling can be in-person or virtual. Platforms like Focusmate connect you with a partner for timed work sessions. Even a video call where both people work silently counts.

### 4. Dopamine Stacking
Pair the difficult task with something that provides dopamine:
- Listen to music you love while doing boring work
- Work in a coffee shop (novelty + ambient stimulation)
- Set a timer and race it (artificial urgency)
- Reward yourself after the first step, not after completion

### 5. Remove All Friction
Before you need to start a task, eliminate every barrier:
- Have the document already open on your screen
- Lay out materials the night before
- Set your environment so starting is the path of least resistance

### 6. Use Artificial Urgency
The ADHD brain responds to urgency even when it ignores importance. Create it:
- Pomodoro timers (25-minute work sprints)
- Promise to show someone your work at a specific time
- Schedule a meeting about the deliverable before it is done

### 7. Commitment Devices
Remove the option to not start:
- Tell someone your plan and ask them to check on you
- Pay in advance for a service tied to the task
- Use apps that block distractions until the task timer runs out

## How SAME Helps

SAME provides multiple task initiation supports:

- **The agent as body double** — Talking through a task with the agent IS starting the task. "Hey, I need to write a project proposal but I cannot start" — the agent asks you three questions and suddenly you have an outline. The conversation IS the activation energy.
- **Automatic next-action surfacing** — `get_session_context` loads your pending tasks at session start. You do not have to remember what to work on or build up the will to check your list. It is already there.
- **Micro-step generation** — Ask the agent to break any task into the smallest possible steps. It can take "write quarterly report" and turn it into "open the template, fill in the date, paste last quarter's numbers." The agent does the cognitive work of decomposition so you do not need activation energy for that step.
- **Momentum preservation** — Session handoffs capture exactly where you left off. When you come back, the agent says "last time you finished the outline and were about to start section 2." No re-loading context. No figuring out where you were. Just continue.
- **Progress visibility** — The agent can surface what you have accomplished this session, today, this week. Seeing forward motion generates dopamine, which lowers activation energy for the next task.

The critical shift: you do not need to start alone. The agent is always available as a launch partner.
