# ADHD at Work: Professional Survival Strategies

## The Professional ADHD Experience

Working with ADHD in a professional environment means operating in a system designed for neurotypical brains. Open offices, long meetings, email-heavy cultures, and deadline-driven workflows all assume executive function that ADHD brains allocate differently.

This note covers practical strategies for navigating professional settings. It is not disclosure advice — whether, when, and how to share an ADHD diagnosis is a personal decision that depends on your specific workplace culture, relationship with management, and legal protections in your jurisdiction.

## Meeting Management

Meetings are an ADHD minefield: sustained attention required, no physical movement, multiple speakers to track, and action items to remember.

### Before the Meeting
- **Request agendas in advance** — Knowing what is coming lets you pre-load context instead of scrambling to understand in real-time
- **Review related documents** — Spend 5 minutes so the material is fresh in working memory
- **Set an intention** — "In this meeting, I need to learn X / decide Y / communicate Z"
- **Eat and hydrate** — Blood sugar drops tank attention

### During the Meeting
- **Take notes by hand** — The physical act of writing engages focus differently than typing. If handwriting is too slow, use a laptop but close everything except the notes document.
- **Use the "parking lot" method** — When your mind wanders, write down the distracting thought and return to the meeting. Process the parking lot afterward.
- **Ask clarifying questions** — This re-engages your attention and ensures you actually heard what was said
- **Stand or move if possible** — Standing meetings, walking meetings, or simply fidgeting can help. A discreet fidget tool under the table works for in-person meetings.

### After the Meeting
- **Immediately capture action items** — Within 2 minutes of the meeting ending, write down what you committed to. Do not trust yourself to remember.
- **Send a summary email** — "Here is what I took away from the meeting: [items]. Let me know if I missed anything." This confirms understanding and creates a written record.

## Email Overwhelm

Email is attention death by a thousand cuts. Every message is a micro-decision: read, respond, defer, delete, delegate.

### Strategies
- **Batch processing** — Check email 2-3 times per day at set times, not continuously. Turn off notifications between batches.
- **The 2-minute rule** — If a response takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. Otherwise, flag it and move on.
- **Templates and snippets** — Create templates for common responses. Reduce the cognitive cost of each reply.
- **One-touch rule** — Try to handle each email only once. Read it, decide what to do, and act. "Read now, decide later" means you will read it three more times.
- **Filters and folders** — Automatically sort newsletters, notifications, and low-priority messages. Your inbox should show only items that require your attention.
- **Written communication over verbal** — Ask colleagues to put requests in email or messages so you have a written record. "Can you Slack me that?" protects your working memory.

## Open Office Survival

Open offices are hostile environments for ADHD. Every conversation, every movement, every notification in your peripheral vision competes for your attention.

### Strategies
- **Noise-canceling headphones** — Your single most important tool. Even if you are not listening to anything, they signal "do not disturb" and block auditory distractions.
- **Face the wall** — Position your screen away from foot traffic and visual movement
- **Focus music or white noise** — Audio that masks conversations without demanding attention
- **Remote work when possible** — If your company allows it, use remote days for deep work
- **Book a conference room** — For your most important focused work, reserve a private space
- **Visual signals** — Some teams use a sign or colored indicator for "I'm in deep focus, please don't interrupt unless urgent"

## Deadline Management with Managers

ADHD and deadlines have a complicated relationship. You either finish early (hyperfocus) or scramble at the last second (time blindness). Neither pattern builds trust with management.

### Strategies
- **Request intermediate checkpoints** — "Can we check in on this Wednesday?" creates artificial deadlines that your brain actually responds to
- **Over-communicate progress** — Send brief progress updates proactively. "Here is where I am on the project." This builds trust and creates external accountability.
- **Negotiate realistic timelines** — Apply the 1.5x multiplier to your time estimates before committing. "I think this will take a week" means commit to a week and a half.
- **Build in buffer** — Set your personal deadline 2-3 days before the real deadline. Tell yourself the earlier date is the real one.
- **Ask for written priorities** — "I have projects A, B, and C. Which is most important this week?" Written prioritization from your manager prevents the ADHD trap of working on whichever feels most interesting.

## Navigating Performance Reviews

Performance reviews can trigger intense RSD (rejection sensitivity). Prepare for this:

- **Request written feedback in advance** — Reading criticism in private gives you time to process emotionally before responding
- **Prepare a list of accomplishments** — ADHD brains forget their own wins. Review your calendar, email, and project history before the review.
- **Bring data** — Concrete numbers and delivered results are harder to dismiss than vague claims
- **Expect the emotional reaction** — If criticism hits hard, it is okay to say "I would like to think about this and follow up tomorrow." Buying time prevents emotional responses.

## How SAME Helps

SAME provides a professional support layer that is invisible to colleagues:

- **Pre-meeting context** — Before a meeting, search your notes for everything related to the topic. The agent surfaces past decisions, project history, and your notes from previous meetings on the same subject. Walk in prepared.
- **Post-meeting capture** — Tell the agent what happened in the meeting and what you committed to. It becomes a searchable record that your working memory does not have to maintain.
- **Email drafting support** — Struggle with writing clear, concise emails? The agent helps draft responses, ensuring nothing is missed. Feed it the context and get a polished reply.
- **Progress reports on demand** — Need to show your manager what you accomplished this week? The agent can search your session handoffs and compile a progress summary. No more scrambling to reconstruct your week.
- **Priority filtering** — When your manager says "focus on project A" but project B feels more interesting, the agent surfaces the stated priority every session. External reinforcement of what matters.
- **Performance review preparation** — Search your notes for accomplishments, completed projects, positive feedback, and measurable outcomes. Build your case with data you already captured over the course of months.
- **Decision paper trail** — "Why did we choose approach X?" The agent can pull up the decision log entry with full reasoning. This is invaluable in meetings where decisions are questioned.

The professional value of SAME is that it gives you the appearance of having flawless organizational skills. Nobody needs to know it is prosthetic — they just see someone who always has context, never loses track of commitments, and can pull up any piece of information on demand.
