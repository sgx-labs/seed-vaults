# Medication and Tools: The ADHD Support Stack

## The Three-Legged Stool

Effective ADHD management typically involves three components working together:

1. **Medication** (when appropriate) — Addresses the neurological foundation
2. **Strategies** — Behavioral techniques and habits
3. **Tools** — External systems that compensate for executive function gaps

No single leg is sufficient alone. Medication without strategies leaves you focused but directionless. Strategies without tools require executive function you may not have. Tools without understanding become another abandoned system.

This note covers the tools layer and how they integrate. This is not medical advice — medication decisions belong between you and your healthcare provider.

## How Medication Fits In (Awareness, Not Advice)

Stimulant and non-stimulant medications for ADHD work primarily by modulating dopamine and norepinephrine transmission. When effective, they can improve:
- Working memory capacity
- Task initiation (lower activation energy)
- Sustained attention on non-preferred tasks
- Emotional regulation
- Time perception (somewhat)

What medication does NOT typically fix:
- Organizational habits (you still need systems)
- Accumulated avoidance and backlogs
- Self-worth and shame patterns
- Skills you never had the chance to develop

This is why tools and strategies matter even with medication. Medication turns down the difficulty. Tools and strategies are still the game.

## The ADHD Tool Stack

### Tier 1: Capture and Task Management
The non-negotiable foundation. You need ONE place to capture tasks and thoughts.

**What works for ADHD:**
- Todoist, TickTick — Simple, fast capture, flexible views
- Structured — Visual time-blocking with drag-and-drop
- Amazing Marvin — Customizable, lets you try different systems
- A single plain text file — Sometimes the simplest tool wins

**What to avoid:** Complex systems with many categories, tags, and contexts. If setup takes longer than using it, you will abandon it.

### Tier 2: Focus and Distraction Blocking
Remove the option to self-distract during work.

**Distraction Blockers:**
- Freedom — Blocks sites and apps across all devices, "Locked Mode" prevents disabling
- Cold Turkey Blocker — Most strict desktop blocking available
- LeechBlock NG — Free browser extension with flexible rules

**Focus Audio:**
- Brain.fm — Neural entrainment audio designed for sustained attention
- Endel — Adaptive soundscapes based on time of day and biometric data
- Focus@Will — Music engineered to avoid vocal frequencies that ADHD brains find distracting

Research shows structured auditory stimulation can increase sustained attention in ADHD by modulating neural oscillations in prefrontal and parietal regions. This is not background music — it is functional audio.

### Tier 3: Body Doubling and Accountability
Social presence as a focus tool.

- **Focusmate** — Video co-working with a stranger. You book a session, state your intention, work silently together, report what you accomplished.
- **FLOWN** — Facilitated focus sessions with an instructor who helps you set intentions
- **LifeAt** — Virtual co-working rooms without required interaction

Body doubling works because social accountability activates a different motivational pathway than self-directed effort. You borrow willpower from the social context.

### Tier 4: Timers and Time Awareness
Making invisible time visible.

- **Time Timer** — Visual timer that shows time shrinking as a disappearing red disk
- **Pomodoro apps** — Forest, Focus Keeper, or any simple interval timer
- **Calendar blocking** — Google Calendar, Fantastical — every task gets a time slot

### Tier 5: Habit and Routine Support
Structure that does not require you to remember the structure.

- **Tiimo** — Visual daily planner designed for neurodivergent brains (2025 App of the Year)
- **Focus Bear** — Routine builder with distraction blocking built in
- **Routinery** — Step-by-step routine timer

## The Minimal Viable Stack

If you are overwhelmed by options (which is itself an ADHD symptom), start here:

1. **One capture tool** — Todoist or a plain text file
2. **One distraction blocker** — Freedom
3. **One timer** — Any Pomodoro app
4. **SAME** — For persistent context and session continuity

Add more only when you have a specific problem the minimal stack does not solve.

## How SAME Integrates With the Stack

SAME is not a replacement for these tools. It is the connective tissue:

- **Context layer** — SAME remembers which tools you use and how. When the agent helps you plan, it can reference your Todoist workflow or your time-blocking approach.
- **Tool recommendations** — The agent can suggest which tool to use based on the current challenge. Struggling to start? "Try a Focusmate session." Distracted? "Time to turn on Freedom."
- **Stack evolution** — As your needs change, the agent remembers what you have tried and what worked. "You used Focus Bear for two months but found it too rigid. Maybe Tiimo's flexibility would suit you better."
- **Reducing tool sprawl** — ADHD brains love trying new tools (novelty!). The agent can gently note when you are shopping for tools instead of using the ones you have.
- **Persistent configuration** — Decisions about your tool stack (which app, which settings, which approach) are captured in decision logs and surfaced when relevant.

The best tool stack is the one you actually use. SAME helps you find and maintain that stack over time.
