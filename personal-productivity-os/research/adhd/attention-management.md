# Attention Management: The Real Skill ADHD Brains Need

## Forget Time Management

Most productivity advice focuses on time management: schedule your day, block your calendar, allocate hours. For ADHD brains, this misses the point entirely. You do not have a time problem. You have an attention problem.

An hour of scattered attention produces nothing. Twenty minutes of locked-in attention produces miracles. The resource to manage is not time — it is attention.

## Four Types of Attention

Attention is not one thing. It has distinct modes, and ADHD affects each differently:

### 1. Focused Attention
Zeroing in on a single stimulus or task. This is what people mean when they say "pay attention."

- **ADHD impact:** Highly variable. Can be extraordinary (hyperfocus) or nearly impossible, depending on interest and dopamine state.
- **Best for:** Deep work, writing, coding, creative tasks

### 2. Sustained Attention
Maintaining focus over time on something that is not inherently stimulating.

- **ADHD impact:** This is the biggest deficit. Sustained attention on boring tasks degrades rapidly. Estimated at 10-15 minutes for non-preferred tasks before the brain seeks stimulation.
- **Best for:** Monitoring tasks, routine work, long meetings

### 3. Selective Attention
Filtering relevant information from noise. Focusing on one conversation in a noisy room.

- **ADHD impact:** Impaired. ADHD brains struggle to suppress irrelevant stimuli. Open offices, notification sounds, and visual clutter all compete for attention.
- **Best for:** Working in shared spaces, reading in noisy environments

### 4. Divided Attention
Handling multiple streams of information simultaneously.

- **ADHD impact:** Paradoxically, sometimes better than neurotypical. ADHD brains can handle multiple low-demand streams. But adding one high-demand task collapses everything.
- **Best for:** Simple multitasking only (music + work, walking + thinking)

## Energy x Attention Mapping

Your attention capacity varies throughout the day based on energy. Instead of scheduling tasks by time, schedule them by attention state:

| Energy Level | Attention Available | Best Tasks |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Peak** (usually morning) | Focused + Sustained | Deep work, creative projects, complex decisions |
| **Mid** (midday) | Focused (short bursts) | Meetings, collaboration, email triage |
| **Low** (afternoon dip) | Selective only | Routine tasks, data entry, inbox cleanup |
| **Recovery** (evening) | Divided at best | Light reading, planning tomorrow, casual learning |

These are general patterns. Track your own energy for a week to find your actual peaks and valleys.

## Matching Work to Attention State

The biggest mistake: trying to do deep creative work during a low-energy state. The second biggest: wasting your peak attention on email.

### Peak Attention Rules
- Protect your peak hours fiercely — this is when your hardest, most important work happens
- Start immediately on your most important task (do not "warm up" with email)
- Eliminate all distractions during peak hours
- Time-box peak work to prevent burnout (2-3 hours max)

### Low Attention Rules
- Do not fight it — work with the low state
- Queue up low-demand tasks for these periods
- Use the time for: processing inbox, organizing files, routine communications
- Light physical movement can temporarily boost attention

### The Transition Zone
Between states, your attention is unstable. This is when you are most vulnerable to distraction. Have a pre-planned activity for transitions so you do not default to doomscrolling.

## Attention Debt

Every distraction creates attention debt: residual mental load from the interrupted task. Research shows it takes an average of 23 minutes to fully recover focus after an interruption. For ADHD brains, this can be longer.

Strategies to minimize attention debt:
- **Batch interruptions** — Check email and messages at set times, not continuously
- **Finish before switching** — Even finishing a small sub-task before switching reduces residue
- **Write a "where I am" note** before any interruption — reduces re-loading time when you return
- **Use "parking lot" notes** for intrusive thoughts about other tasks

## The Attention Budget

Think of your daily attention as a budget. You have a limited amount, and every task spends some:

- Deep creative work: High cost, high return
- Meetings: High cost, variable return
- Email: Medium cost, low return
- Context switching: Pure cost, zero return

Budget your best attention for your highest-value work. Spend the rest on everything else. Refuse to spend premium attention on low-value tasks.

## How SAME Helps

SAME supports attention management in several ways:

- **Right work, right time** — The agent knows your pending tasks and can suggest which to tackle based on your described energy state. "I am feeling low energy" prompts it to surface routine tasks. "I am locked in" prompts it to surface your deep work priorities.
- **Reduced context-loading cost** — `get_session_context` pre-loads your working context. Instead of spending 15-20 minutes of peak attention remembering where you were, you start with context ready. That saves your best attention for actual work.
- **Distraction capture** — When an unrelated thought hits during focused work, tell the agent. It captures it in a note or handoff so you can let it go without losing it. The thought is safe; your attention stays on task.
- **Attention pattern tracking** — Over multiple sessions, the agent builds a picture of when you are most productive. It can reflect this back to you, helping you optimize your schedule around your actual attention patterns.
- **Session pacing** — The agent can help you chunk work into attention-appropriate blocks. Instead of one overwhelming three-hour task, it helps you plan three focused sprints with intentional breaks.
- **Priority filtering** — When everything feels equally demanding, the agent can filter to your pinned priorities and recent decisions, cutting the noise so your limited attention goes to what actually matters.

The fundamental insight: time is democratic — everyone gets 24 hours. Attention is not. Managing yours is the real productivity skill.
