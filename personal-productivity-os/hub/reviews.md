# Reviews — The Engine of Your System

## Overview

Reviews are the engine of continuous improvement. A weekly review keeps your system trustworthy, a monthly retrospective reveals patterns in how you work, and journaling builds reflection into your routine. This hub covers review consistency strategies, after-action review techniques, and frameworks for learning from experience so that each week is better than the last. The habit of regular reflection is what separates a living system from a graveyard of stale tasks.

## Review Cadence

### Weekly Review (15-30 minutes)
The most important habit in this entire system. Do it at the same time every week.

**What it covers:**
1. Process inbox / capture backlog
2. Review active projects — update status
3. Check calendar for the coming week
4. Identify top 3 priorities for next week
5. Log wins and lessons from this week

Template: `templates/weekly-review.md`
See: `research/reviews/weekly-review-15min.md`

### Monthly Review (45-60 minutes)
Zoom out from tasks to themes. Are you spending time on what matters?

**What it covers:**
1. Review weekly review notes from the past month
2. Check goal progress in `current-state/goals.md`
3. Identify patterns: what is working, what is not
4. Adjust priorities for the coming month
5. Archive completed projects

Template: `templates/monthly-review.md`
See: `research/reviews/monthly-review-framework.md`

### Quarterly Review (2-3 hours)
Set new goals, reflect on the quarter, adjust your system.

**What it covers:**
1. Goal retrospective: achieved, missed, adjusted
2. Project retrospective: completed, dropped, started
3. System retrospective: what is working in your process
4. Set goals for next quarter
5. Update entity files

See: `hub/goals.md`, `research/goals/quarterly-planning.md`

## The Consistency Trap

The biggest risk is not doing a bad review — it is skipping the review entirely. A 10-minute review beats a skipped review every time. If the template feels too long, do the shortened version:

1. What did I accomplish?
2. What is my top priority next week?
3. Is anything blocked?
