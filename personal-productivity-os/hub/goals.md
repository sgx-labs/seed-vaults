# Goals — Setting Direction, Tracking Progress

## Overview

Goal setting turns vague ambitions into measurable progress through quarterly planning, OKR frameworks, and annual themes. This hub covers setting priorities you can actually track, building habits that stick, saying no to protect focus, and maintaining alignment between daily actions and long-term outcomes. Review goals weekly, adjust monthly, and hold yourself accountable with a system that surfaces progress — not guilt.

## Goal Setting Cadence

| Timeframe | What to Set | Review Cadence |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Annual | 2-3 themes or big outcomes | Quarterly |
| Quarterly | 3-5 specific, measurable goals | Weekly |
| Monthly | Check-in: on track, adjust, or drop | Monthly review |
| Weekly | Progress notes, blockers | Weekly review |

## Goal Quality Checklist

A good goal answers these questions:
- **Specific**: What exactly will be different when this is done?
- **Measurable**: How will I know I achieved it?
- **Time-bound**: By when?
- **Connected**: Does this serve a bigger objective?
- **Controllable**: Is progress within my influence?

## Your Goals

Live goal tracking is in `current-state/goals.md`. The agent helps you maintain this through weekly reviews.

## Quarterly Planning Process

1. Review last quarter: what was achieved, what was dropped, what surprised you
2. Identify 2-3 themes for the next quarter
3. Set 3-5 specific goals under those themes
4. For each goal, define the first project or action
5. Update `current-state/goals.md`

See: `research/goals/quarterly-planning.md`

## Common Traps

- **Too many goals**: 3-5 per quarter max. More means less focus.
- **Outcome goals only**: Add process goals ("write 500 words daily") alongside outcome goals ("publish the book").
- **No connection to daily work**: Every week, ask: "Did my actions this week serve my goals?"
- **Never adjusting**: Goals set in January may not fit in March. Adjust without guilt.
