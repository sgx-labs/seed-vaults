# Thinking and Mental Models

## Overview

Mental models are frameworks for thinking clearly under uncertainty. They help you make better decisions, avoid cognitive traps, and see situations from multiple angles. This hub covers core mental models for everyday decisions, cognitive bias awareness to catch systematic thinking errors, and implementation strategies that turn insight into action.

Whether you're facing a major career decision, a project risk assessment, or just trying to think more clearly about your priorities, these models provide structure for your thinking.

## Core Mental Models

| Note | Focus |
|------|-------|
| research/thinking/mental-models-core.md | Five foundational models: inversion, first principles, second-order thinking, circle of competence, map vs. territory |
| research/thinking/implementation-intentions.md | If-then planning to bridge intention-action gap |
| research/thinking/environment-design.md | Shape your environment to make good decisions automatic |

## Decision Tools

| Note | Focus |
|------|-------|
| research/thinking/pre-mortem.md | Imagine failure before it happens to prevent it |
| research/thinking/fear-setting.md | Tim Ferriss technique for decisions you're avoiding |
| research/thinking/regret-minimization.md | Bezos framework for irreversible choices |
| research/thinking/opportunity-cost.md | What you're giving up by choosing this path |

## Bias Awareness

| Note | Focus |
|------|-------|
| research/thinking/cognitive-biases.md | 12 biases that distort everyday thinking |
| research/thinking/dichotomy-of-control.md | Stoic framework for focusing energy on what you can change |

## How to Use These Models

1. **Before a big decision**: Run the decision-analysis recipe → `recipes/decision-analysis.md`
2. **When stuck on a problem**: Try inversion — ask "What would make this worse?" then avoid those things
3. **When procrastinating on a scary decision**: Use fear-setting → `research/thinking/fear-setting.md`
4. **When you suspect bias**: Check cognitive-biases.md for the specific trap you might be falling into
