# Projects — Tracking What Matters

## Overview

Project management at the personal level means tracking active projects, defining milestones, and knowing the next action for each. A project is any outcome requiring more than one step — track it explicitly or it becomes ambient stress. This hub covers project tracking and status updates, decomposition of large goals into manageable scope, project kickoff discipline, and maintaining priorities so you focus on what matters rather than what is loudest.

## Project Lifecycle

```
Idea → Defined → Active → Blocked/Waiting → Complete → Archived
```

### Active Projects
Your live project list lives in `current-state/projects.md`. The agent updates it as things change. Keep the active list short — 3-5 projects is the sweet spot for most people.

### When to Start a New Project
Use the kickoff template: `templates/project-kickoff.md`. Answer three questions before starting:
1. What does "done" look like?
2. What is the first concrete action?
3. Is this more important than something already on my list?

See: `research/goals/saying-no.md`

## Project Health Checks

| Signal | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| No progress this week | Blocked or deprioritized | Identify the blocker or move to someday |
| Scope keeps growing | Unclear definition of done | Re-scope: what is the minimum viable outcome? |
| Multiple blockers | Dependencies or resource issues | Escalate or renegotiate timeline |
| Completed next action, no new one | Stalled | Define the next physical action |

## Connecting Projects to Goals

Every active project should connect to a goal in `current-state/goals.md`. If a project does not serve any goal, question whether it belongs on your active list.

See: `hub/goals.md`, `research/goals/okr-framework.md`

## Templates

- `templates/project-kickoff.md` — Start a new project with clarity
- `templates/decision-template.md` — Log decisions within a project

## Research Notes

- `research/systems/organize-not-sort.md` — Next actions, not task lists
- `research/goals/saying-no.md` — Frameworks for declining commitments
- `research/decisions/context-switching-cost.md` — Why fewer projects is better
