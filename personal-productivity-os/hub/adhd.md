# ADHD/ADD — Strategies for How Your Brain Actually Works

## A Note Before You Begin

This section exists because ADHD and ADD are among the most common reasons people seek productivity systems — and because most productivity advice quietly assumes a neurotypical brain. If this applies to you, these notes are here to help. If it does not, the strategies here (external systems, body doubling, micro-steps, energy management) are useful for anyone.

No assumptions. No diagnoses. Just research-backed strategies for brains that work differently.

## Overview

ADHD is not a deficit of attention — it is a difference in how attention is regulated. Executive function challenges affect working memory, task initiation, time blindness, and emotional regulation, making standard productivity advice ineffective. This hub covers ADHD-specific strategies for attention management, dopamine-aware motivation, hyperfocus harnessing, and building accommodations that work with your brain instead of against it. The goal is external systems that compensate automatically, not willpower you have to supply.

## The Core Challenges

| Challenge | What It Means | How SAME Helps |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Executive Function** | Planning, starting, staying on track, adjusting | Session context and hooks act as prosthetic executive function |
| **Working Memory** | Holding information while using it (capacity: 2-3 items vs. 4-7) | Vault search surfaces relevant context automatically — no capacity limit |
| **Time Blindness** | Only "now" and "not now" exist — no gradient between them | Session handoffs create temporal anchors; the agent builds your timeline |
| **Task Initiation** | The canyon between "I should" and "I am doing it" | The agent as body double — talking through a task IS starting it |
| **Hyperfocus** | Intense lock-in that cannot be steered voluntarily | Session orientation aims hyperfocus at priorities before it fires |
| **Emotional Regulation** | Small setbacks feel catastrophic; excitement overrides judgment | The agent does not judge; it surfaces past wins and reframes with data |
| **Dopamine** | Motivation tied to interest/novelty/urgency, not importance | Micro-steps, progress visibility, and gamification lower activation energy |

## Why Standard Productivity Advice Fails

Most systems assume you can:
- Start tasks on command (task initiation deficit)
- Estimate how long things take (time blindness)
- Hold priorities in your head (working memory deficit)
- Follow through without external pressure (dopamine-driven motivation)
- Maintain consistent effort over time (variable executive function)

The notes in this section offer strategies that work *with* these differences, not against them.

## Why SAME Is Different

SAME does not ask you to compensate through discipline. It compensates for you:
- **Hooks fire automatically** — context arrives without you checking anything
- **Handoffs preserve state** — you never lose where you were, even after a crash
- **The agent is always available** — body doubling at 11pm on a Sunday, no judgment
- **Decisions stay decided** — no re-litigating settled questions
- **Progress becomes visible** — the agent shows what you accomplished, generating momentum
