# Energy — Manage Energy, Not Just Time

## Overview

Energy management recognizes that not all hours are equal — an hour of deep work during peak focus produces more than three scattered hours after decision fatigue sets in. This hub covers mapping your energy patterns across the day, protecting flow state and focus time, preventing burnout through deliberate recovery and rest, and understanding the real cost of context switching. Match your most demanding work to your peak performance windows, and you accomplish more while working less.

## The Energy Framework

### 1. Know Your Patterns
When are you sharpest? When do you crash? Map your energy across a typical day. Use this to schedule:
- **Peak energy**: Deep work, creative thinking, hard decisions
- **Medium energy**: Meetings, collaboration, communication
- **Low energy**: Admin, email, routine tasks

See: `research/energy/deep-work-flow.md`

### 2. Protect Focus Time
Context switching is the silent killer of productive days. Every switch costs 10-25 minutes of recovery time.

See: `research/energy/context-switching-cost.md`

### 3. Prevent Burnout
Burnout is not about working too hard — it is about working without recovery. Build recovery into your system, not as an afterthought.

See: `research/energy/burnout-prevention.md`

### 4. Build Sustainable Habits
Small, consistent actions beat heroic sprints. Habits reduce decision fatigue by making good behaviors automatic.

## Energy Audit Questions

Ask yourself weekly (part of the weekly review):
- Did I protect my focus time this week?
- How many context switches did I have in a typical day?
- When did I feel most energized? Most drained?
- Did I take real breaks, or just switch screens?
- Am I sleeping enough?

## Warning Signs

| Signal | Severity | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Dreading Monday | Early | Review workload, identify the drain |
| Difficulty concentrating | Moderate | Reduce inputs, take a real break |
| Cynicism about work | Serious | Talk to someone, adjust commitments |
| Physical symptoms | Critical | Step back. No amount of productivity is worth your health. |
