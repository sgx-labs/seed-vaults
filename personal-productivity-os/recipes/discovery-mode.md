# Discovery Mode — Explore What You Don't Know Yet

## Purpose

Structured exploration to find knowledge gaps worth filling. This recipe helps you discover what you don't know, identify what would be most valuable to learn, and seed ideas for things to build or explore.

## When to Use

- You have 15-20 minutes and want to invest in growth
- You feel stuck in a rut and want fresh perspectives
- You want to discover connections between your projects and interests
- The agent suggests it based on patterns in your searches

## Time: 15-20 minutes

## The Script

### Step 1: Pattern Scan (3 minutes)
The agent reviews:
- Recent search queries (what have you been looking for?)
- Current projects (what are you building?)
- Decision log (what have you been deciding?)
- Entity files (what are your goals and interests?)

Present a brief summary: "Here's what I'm noticing about your recent focus areas..."

### Step 2: Gap Identification (3 minutes)
Based on the pattern scan, identify 3 areas where:
- You've searched for something but the vault has no deep coverage
- Your projects could benefit from research you haven't done yet
- There's a connection between two interests you might not have seen

Present them as questions, not obligations:
- "You've been thinking a lot about [X]. Want to go deeper?"
- "I notice [project] might benefit from understanding [topic]. Curious?"
- "There's an interesting connection between [A] and [B]. Want to explore?"

### Step 3: Choose Your Adventure (1 minute)
The user picks ONE area to explore (or suggests their own).

### Step 4: Rabbit Hole (10 minutes)
Use `search_notes` and `find_similar_notes` to surface related content. If the vault doesn't have relevant notes, offer to create a research note on the topic.

During exploration:
- Connect what you find to the user's actual projects and goals
- Suggest quick builds: "You could create a [tool/template/tracker] for this in about 15 minutes"
- Note actionable insights: "This could change how you approach [specific thing]"

### Step 5: Capture and Close (2 minutes)
Ask: "What's the most interesting thing from this exploration?"

Offer to:
1. Create a new research note capturing key insights
2. Add a build idea to the project tracker
3. Schedule a deeper dive for next week
4. Just let it percolate — "Sometimes the best ideas need time to marinate"

## What Gets Updated
- Optional: New research note in relevant directory
- Optional: Build idea added to current-state/projects.md
- Optional: Growth note added to decisions/log.md

## Agent Notes
- This recipe should feel like play, not work
- Follow the user's energy — if they light up about a topic, go deeper there
- Don't force outcomes. Not every exploration needs to produce a deliverable
- The point is curiosity, not productivity
