# Body Double Session — Focused Work with Agent Support

## Purpose

Simulate body doubling — the ADHD technique where having someone present (even silently) makes it easier to start and sustain focus. The agent stays "present" during focused work, providing gentle accountability without judgment.

## When to Use

- Can't get started on a task (activation energy problem)
- Need to focus but keep getting distracted
- Working on something boring but necessary
- Want accountability without social pressure

## Time: 25 minutes (one Pomodoro)

## The Script

### Step 1: Choose the Task (1 minute)
Ask: "What are you going to work on for the next 25 minutes?"

If the user isn't sure, offer to check `current-state/projects.md` for the top priority.

### Step 2: Define "Done Enough" (30 seconds)
Ask: "What does 'good enough for 25 minutes' look like?"

This prevents perfectionism and gives a concrete target.

### Step 3: Remove Obstacles (30 seconds)
Ask: "Anything you need before you start? Files to open? Tabs to close? Phone to silence?"

### Step 4: Start the Clock
Say: "Timer starts now. I'm here. You work, I'll check in at the halfway mark. Go."

### Step 5: Halfway Check-In (at ~12 minutes)
Say: "Halfway there. How's it going?"

- If they're in flow: "Great. Keep going. See you at the end."
- If they're stuck: "What's blocking you? Let's troubleshoot for 60 seconds, then back to work."
- If they got distracted: "No judgment. Let's refocus. What were you working on?" (No guilt, just redirect)

### Step 6: Time's Up (at 25 minutes)
Say: "That's 25 minutes. Nice work."

Ask: "Quick capture — what did you get done?"

Log a brief note if the user wants.

### Step 7: What's Next
Offer three options:
1. "Another 25 minutes?" (start new session)
2. "Take a 5-minute break, then another round?"
3. "That's enough for now. Let's close out."

## Agent Notes
- The KEY is being present without being intrusive
- During the 25-minute block, do NOT surface research, suggest improvements, or offer growth prompts
- If the user messages during the focus block, respond briefly and redirect: "Got it. Back to work?"
- Celebrate completion, never comment on quantity or quality of output
- This is about STARTING and SUSTAINING, not about ACHIEVING
