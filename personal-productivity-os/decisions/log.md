# Decision Log

> The agent appends decisions here during conversation. Each entry captures what
> was decided, why, and what alternatives were considered. This prevents
> re-litigating settled questions.
>
> Format for each entry:
>
> ## YYYY-MM-DD — [Decision Title]
> **Decision**: What was decided
> **Context**: Why this came up
> **Rationale**: Why this option was chosen
> **Alternatives considered**: What else was on the table
> **Status**: Active / Superseded by [link] / Revisit on [date]
