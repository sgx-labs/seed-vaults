# Goals Progress — Q1 2026

> Quarterly goals with key results and progress tracking. The agent
> checks these during weekly reviews and monthly deep-dives. Every
> goal has a "Why This Matters" anchor — motivation for the days
> when discipline alone is not enough.

## Goal 1: Ship the Product Launch

**Why This Matters:** This is the project that proves you can take something
from idea to shipped product. Everything else you want to build depends on
proving this skill to yourself first.

| Key Result                          | Progress                           | Status        |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------|
| Feature spec finalized              | `[####################]` 100%      | [DONE]        |
| Beta testing with 10 users          | `[########............]` 40%       | [IN PROGRESS] |
| Launch communications drafted       | `[####................]` 20%       | [IN PROGRESS] |
| Post-launch retrospective completed | `[....................]` 0%        | [NOT STARTED] |

- **Current status:** On track. Beta feedback coming in, mostly positive.
- **Last update:** 2026-02-12 — Recruited 4 of 10 beta testers.
- **Next milestone:** Hit 10 beta testers by Feb 21.

## Goal 2: Establish a Consistent Exercise Routine

**Why This Matters:** You are sharper, calmer, and more creative on days you
move. This is not about fitness metrics — it is about building a foundation
that makes everything else work better.

| Key Result                          | Progress                           | Status        |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------|
| Exercise 4x per week (avg)          | `[###############.....]` 75%       | [ON TRACK]    |
| Try 3 new activities this quarter   | `[##########..........]` 50%       | [ON TRACK]    |
| Morning routine includes movement   | `[############........]` 60%       | [IN PROGRESS] |

- **Current status:** Good momentum. Averaging 3.5x/week, trending up.
- **Last update:** 2026-02-10 — Added a Tuesday climbing session.
- **Next milestone:** Hit 4x/week average for February.

## Goal 3: Read 12 Books This Quarter

**Why This Matters:** Reading is how you stay curious and develop ideas that
would never come from your daily work alone. One book per week is ambitious
but forces you to be intentional about what you read.

| Key Result                          | Progress                           | Status        |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------|
| Books completed (target: 12)        | `[######..............]` 30%       | [ON TRACK]    |
| Write a 3-sentence review per book  | `[####................]` 20%       | [BEHIND]      |
| Share one insight per book           | `[########............]` 40%       | [ON TRACK]    |

- **Current status:** 4 of 12 books done. Reviews need catching up.
- **Last update:** 2026-02-08 — Finished "Thinking in Systems."
- **Next milestone:** Finish book 5 by Feb 21, write reviews for books 3-4.

## Goal 4: Reduce Decision Fatigue

**Why This Matters:** You waste energy re-deciding things that should already
be settled. Building systems for recurring decisions gives you that energy
back for the choices that actually matter.

| Key Result                          | Progress                           | Status        |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------|
| Log every significant decision      | `[###############.....]` 75%       | [ON TRACK]    |
| Create templates for 5 recurring decisions | `[##########..........]` 50% | [IN PROGRESS] |
| Weekly "decisions pending" is under 3 items | `[######..............]` 30% | [AT RISK]     |

- **Current status:** Logging is strong. The backlog of pending decisions needs work.
- **Last update:** 2026-02-11 — Created template for vendor evaluations.
- **Next milestone:** Clear the pending decisions list to under 3 by Feb 17.

## Monthly Check-in Prompts

_The agent asks these at the start of each month:_

1. Look at each goal's "Why This Matters." Does it still resonate? If not, update it.
2. Are any goals clearly off track? What would it take to recover — or should you adjust the target?
3. Which goal are you most proud of your progress on?
4. Which goal have you been avoiding? Why?
5. Is there anything you have learned this month that changes what you should be working toward?
