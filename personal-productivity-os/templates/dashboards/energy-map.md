# Energy Map

> The agent builds this picture over time by asking how you felt during
> different parts of the day. Over weeks, patterns emerge: when you do
> your best thinking, when to schedule meetings, when to stop pushing.

## This Week's Energy Grid

_Scale: H = High (deep work ready) / M = Medium (routine tasks) / L = Low (admin only) / -- = no data_

| Time Block    | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun |
|---------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Early (6-8)   | M   | M   | H   | M   | L   | --  | --  |
| Morning (8-10) | H   | H   | H   | H   | M   | --  | --  |
| Late AM (10-12)| H   | M   | H   | M   | M   | --  | --  |
| Lunch (12-1)  | L   | L   | L   | L   | L   | --  | --  |
| Early PM (1-3) | M   | L   | M   | L   | L   | --  | --  |
| Late PM (3-5) | L   | M   | M   | M   | L   | --  | --  |
| Evening (5-7) | M   | L   | L   | L   | --  | --  | --  |

## Pattern Summary

_The agent updates this section as enough data accumulates (2+ weeks)._

**Peak performance windows:**
- Tuesday and Wednesday mornings (8-12) are consistently your best deep work slots
- Early mornings before 8am are productive when you slept well the night before

**Consistent low points:**
- Post-lunch dip (1-3pm) happens almost every day
- Friday afternoons are reliably low energy — stop scheduling important work here

**Influencing factors observed:**
- Days with 3+ meetings: energy drops 1 level across the board
- Days with morning exercise: afternoon energy stays at Medium instead of Low
- Back-to-back meetings without breaks produce the steepest declines

## Recommendations

_Based on your patterns, the agent suggests:_

1. **Protect 8-12 Tuesday/Wednesday** for your most important deep work. These are your golden hours.
2. **Schedule meetings for 1-3pm** when possible — you are in a natural dip anyway.
3. **Add a 15-minute walk after lunch** — this has correlated with better afternoon energy on the days you did it.
4. **Stop scheduling Friday afternoon commitments** — use this time for low-stakes admin, cleanup, or early weekend.
5. **Exercise in the morning** when you need an afternoon to stay productive.

## Weekly Energy Score

_Average energy across the work week (Mon-Fri), tracked over time._

| Week Of    | Avg Score | Notes                                |
|------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| 2026-02-10 | 2.3 / 3   | Good week, protected focus time     |
| 2026-02-03 | 1.8 / 3   | Too many meetings, felt scattered   |
| 2026-01-27 | 2.1 / 3   | Solid, but Thursday was rough       |
| 2026-01-20 | 2.5 / 3   | Best week this month                |

_Scoring: H=3, M=2, L=1. Average across all tracked blocks._

## How This Works

The agent asks a simple question during conversations:

> "How is your energy right now — high, medium, or low?"

Over time, these data points fill in the grid. After two weeks, the agent
starts identifying patterns and making scheduling recommendations. You do
not need to remember to track anything — the agent handles the asking and
the recording.
