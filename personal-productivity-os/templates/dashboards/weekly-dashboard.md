## Wins This Week

- Delivered the Alpha milestone two days early
- Said no to a meeting that would have eaten Wednesday
- Finally finished the Go course module I had been avoiding

---

## Lessons Learned

- Scheduling deep work right after lunch does not work — energy is too low
- The 15-minute buffer between meetings made a noticeable difference
- Writing the proposal outline first (before research) saved time
