# Vault Growth Dashboard

> This dashboard shows your vault's growth over time. All metrics are descriptive — there are no targets or expectations. Use what's helpful, ignore what isn't.
>
> The agent updates this at session start. You never maintain it manually.

## Research Coverage

_Areas with strong coverage and identified gaps._

**Well-covered:**
- [TOPIC] — [N] notes
- [TOPIC] — [N] notes
- [TOPIC] — [N] notes

**Gaps identified:**
- [TOPIC] — no notes yet, referenced [N] times in other notes
- [TOPIC] — last updated [DATE], may be stale

## Next Research to Create

_Based on gaps, search patterns, and cross-references to non-existent notes._

1. [TOPIC] — referenced in [SOURCE NOTE] but does not exist yet
2. [TOPIC] — searched for [N] times but no matching notes
3. [TOPIC] — related to active project, would fill a gap

## Compound Growth Indicators

These are signals that the vault is getting more useful over time, not just bigger.

- **Cross-references:** [N] notes link to other notes
- **Decision reuse:** [N] times a past decision was surfaced to inform a new one
- **Search hit rate:** [PERCENTAGE] of searches return relevant results
