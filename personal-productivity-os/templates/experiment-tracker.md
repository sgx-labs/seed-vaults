# Experiment — [NAME]

> Use this template to test a new approach for at least 2 weeks before deciding
> whether to adopt, adapt, or abandon it. This prevents the cycle of trying
> something for 2 days and giving up before results can appear.

## Hypothesis

**If I** [specific behavior change], **I expect** [specific observable outcome].

> Be concrete. "If I time-block my mornings for deep work, I expect to complete
> at least one major task before noon on 4 out of 5 workdays."

## Check-In Log

Record brief observations. Do not overthink these — a sentence or two is enough.

## Decision

- [ ] **Adopt** — It works. Make it a permanent part of the system.
- [ ] **Adapt** — The core idea works but needs adjustment. Describe what to change and run another 2-week experiment.
- [ ] **Abandon** — It does not work for me. Document why so I do not re-try the same approach later.

**Rationale:**

## Example Experiments

### Example 1: Time-Blocking Mornings

- **Hypothesis:** If I block 8am-11am for deep work with no meetings or messages, I expect to finish my highest-priority task before lunch on at least 4 out of 5 days.
- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Measure:** Did the priority task get done before noon? (Yes/No per day)
- **Possible outcomes:** Adopt if 4+ days/week. Adapt if 2-3 days (maybe shorten the block). Abandon if consistently interrupted.

### Example 2: Standing Desk Afternoons

- **Hypothesis:** If I switch to standing for all afternoon work (1pm-5pm), I expect my afternoon energy levels to stay at "medium" or higher instead of the current drop to "low."
- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Measure:** Self-reported afternoon energy (High / Medium / Low) at 3pm each day.
- **Possible outcomes:** Adopt if energy stays medium+. Adapt if legs tire (try alternating hours). Abandon if no energy difference.

### Example 3: No-Meeting Wednesdays

- **Hypothesis:** If I decline all Wednesday meetings and use the day for deep project work, I expect to make twice the progress on my primary project compared to other days.
- **Duration:** 3 weeks (to account for schedule variability)
- **Measure:** Weekly project progress notes comparing Wednesday output to other days.
- **Possible outcomes:** Adopt if Wednesday consistently produces the most progress. Adapt if some meetings are truly essential (move only those). Abandon if the rest of the week gets overloaded to compensate.

## How SAME Helps

- The agent can prompt for experiment check-ins during sessions: "You started the morning time-block experiment 5 days ago. How is it going?"
- **`search_notes`** for past experiments prevents re-running the same failed experiment. If you tried no-meeting Wednesdays before and it did not work, the record explains why.
- **`save_decision`** logs the final adopt/adapt/abandon decision with rationale, creating a searchable history of what works for you.
- Over time, your experiment archive becomes a personal playbook — a tested library of approaches, not just ideas.
