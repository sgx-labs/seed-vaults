# Bootstrap — Fitness & Wellness Quick Reference

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**This vault is for educational and informational purposes only. It is NOT medical advice.** Consult a physician before starting any exercise program. Stop any exercise that causes sharp pain. See a qualified professional for injuries or medical conditions.

## Overview

Your evidence-based fitness and wellness knowledge base — strength training, cardio, mobility, recovery, nutrition, and habit building. All recommendations are grounded in exercise science from ACSM, NSCA, and peer-reviewed research. Start here to find what you need.

## QUICK LOOKUP TABLE

| Goal | Start Here | Key Concept |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Start lifting weights | `research/strength/beginner-strength-program.md` | Compound movements, 3x/week |
| Improve deadlift form | `research/strength/deadlift-technique.md` | Hip hinge, neutral spine |
| Improve squat form | `research/strength/squat-technique.md` | Depth, knee tracking, bracing |
| Break a plateau | `research/strength/progressive-overload.md` | Volume, intensity, variation |
| Start running | `research/cardio/couch-to-running.md` | Walk/run intervals, gradual |
| Understand HR zones | `research/cardio/heart-rate-zones.md` | Zone 2 base, Zone 4-5 peaks |
| Warm up properly | `research/mobility/evidence-based-warmup.md` | Dynamic movement, not static |
| Fix tight hips | `research/mobility/hip-mobility.md` | 90/90, hip flexor stretches |
| Recover better | `research/recovery/sleep-and-recovery.md` | Sleep > everything else |
| Know when to rest | `research/recovery/deload-and-rest.md` | Every 4-6 weeks, listen to body |
| Pre/post workout food | `research/nutrition/pre-post-workout.md` | Protein + carbs, timing flexible |
| Protein needs | `research/nutrition/protein-guide.md` | 0.7-1g per lb bodyweight |
| Stay consistent | `research/habits/building-consistency.md` | Identity, systems, minimum doses |
| Handle an injury | `research/injuries/training-around-injury.md` | Modify, don't stop entirely |

## Training Week Template

A balanced week for general fitness (adjust to your level):

| Day | Focus | Example |
|-----|-------|---------|
| Mon | Strength (push) | Bench, overhead press, accessories |
| Tue | Cardio (easy) | 30-45 min Zone 2 (walk/jog/bike) |
| Wed | Strength (pull) | Deadlift, rows, accessories |
| Thu | Rest or mobility | Foam rolling, stretching, walk |
| Fri | Strength (legs) | Squat, lunges, accessories |
| Sat | Cardio (harder) | HIIT, sport, or longer Zone 2 |
| Sun | Full rest | Recovery, sleep, life |

*This is a starting framework. Adjust based on your goals, recovery, and schedule.*

## Where To Find Things

| Need | Search for | Or read directly |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Strength training | `squat deadlift bench program` | `hub/strength-training.md` |
| Cardio guides | `running HIIT heart rate zones` | `hub/cardio-and-conditioning.md` |
| Mobility/recovery | `stretching foam rolling warm up` | `hub/mobility-and-recovery.md` |
| Training nutrition | `protein carbs pre-workout` | `hub/nutrition-for-training.md` |
| Staying consistent | `motivation habits routine` | `hub/habit-building.md` |
| Pain/injury help | `knee pain shoulder impingement` | `hub/common-issues.md` |

## How To Use This Vault

```bash
# Search for training help
same search "how to improve my squat depth"

# Via MCP during a session
mcp__same__search_notes(query="rest day active recovery", top_k=3)

# Find related topics
mcp__same__find_similar_notes(path="research/strength/progressive-overload.md", top_k=3)
```

## Key Principles

1. **Progressive overload** — Gradually increase demands over time
2. **Specificity** — Train for what you want to improve
3. **Recovery** — Adaptation happens during rest, not during training
4. **Consistency** — Showing up matters more than perfection
5. **Individual variation** — What works for others may not work for you
