# Mobility & Recovery

Mobility is the ability to move a joint through its full range of motion under control and with strength. It is not the same as flexibility, which is passive range of motion. You can be flexible enough to do the splits but lack the mobility to control a deep squat under load. Effective mobility work is specific to the movements you need to perform, performed consistently in small doses, and progressed over time — just like strength training. Recovery encompasses everything that happens between training sessions: sleep, nutrition, stress management, and targeted restoration work like foam rolling and stretching.

## Key Concepts

### Mobility Is Strength Through Range of Motion
A common misconception is that mobility problems are solved by stretching more. In many cases, the limitation is not tissue tightness but a lack of motor control and strength at end ranges. Exercises like controlled articular rotations (CARs), isometric holds at end range, and loaded stretches (such as a deep pause squat or a dumbbell fly) build usable range of motion that transfers to training.

### Dynamic Before, Static After
The research is reasonably clear on warm-up sequencing. Dynamic movements — leg swings, arm circles, bodyweight squats, lunges with a twist — prepare your nervous system and increase tissue temperature before training. Static stretching before heavy lifting can transiently reduce force output. Save static holds for after training or as a standalone session when the goal is long-term flexibility gains.

### Foam Rolling: Useful but Misunderstood
Foam rolling does not "break up adhesions" or permanently lengthen fascia. What it does do is temporarily increase range of motion (likely through neurological mechanisms — pain modulation and reduced muscle tone) and may reduce perceived soreness. Use it as a warm-up tool for 1-2 minutes per area, not as a 30-minute daily ritual. If an area is persistently tight or painful despite consistent rolling, the problem is likely elsewhere.

### Sleep Is the Ultimate Recovery Tool
No supplement, device, or protocol matches the recovery power of 7-9 hours of quality sleep. Sleep is when growth hormone peaks, when muscle protein synthesis is elevated, and when the brain consolidates motor learning from your training session. If you have one hour to invest in recovery, spend it sleeping earlier — not foam rolling.

### Active Recovery vs. Complete Rest
Light movement on rest days — walking, easy cycling, gentle yoga — promotes blood flow and may reduce soreness more effectively than doing nothing. But active recovery should feel genuinely easy. If your "recovery session" leaves you fatigued, it is another training session.
