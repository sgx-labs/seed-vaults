# Nutrition for Training

> **Disclaimer:** This content is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. Consult a physician before starting any exercise program. Consult a qualified professional for injuries or medical conditions.

Nutrition supports training — it does not need to replace it as your primary focus. The fundamentals are straightforward: eat enough protein at every meal, consume sufficient calories to support your training goals, stay hydrated, and get most of your nutrition from minimally processed whole foods. Beyond these basics, the details matter far less than most fitness content would have you believe. The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) publishes evidence-based position stands on most nutrition topics, and their consistent message is that consistency and adequacy trump optimization and timing tricks.

## Key Concepts

### Protein: The One Macronutrient Worth Tracking
If you only track one thing, make it protein. The ISSN recommends 1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight per day for individuals engaged in resistance training (Jager et al., 2017). Distribute protein across 3-5 meals per day, aiming for at least 20-40g per meal to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis. Beyond this threshold, the source (whey, chicken, tofu, legumes) matters less than total daily intake.

### Calories Determine Direction
Whether you gain, lose, or maintain weight is primarily determined by your caloric balance. Eating in a surplus (more calories than you burn) supports muscle gain. Eating in a deficit supports fat loss. Eating at maintenance supports body recomposition, especially in less-trained individuals. You do not need to count calories obsessively — portion awareness, consistent meal patterns, and monitoring body weight trends can be sufficient for most goals.

### The Anabolic Window Is a Garage Door
The idea that you must consume protein within 30 minutes of training or lose your gains has been thoroughly debunked. The "anabolic window" is better thought of as an "anabolic garage door" — it is open for several hours. What matters more is your total daily protein intake and having a protein-rich meal somewhere in the 2-3 hours before or after training (Schoenfeld & Aragon, 2018).

### Supplements Are the 1%
Creatine monohydrate is the most researched and effective legal supplement for strength and power output — 3-5g daily, no loading phase necessary. Caffeine improves performance at 3-6 mg/kg body weight. Vitamin D supplementation makes sense if your levels are low (common in northern latitudes). Beyond these, most supplements are expensive placebos. No supplement compensates for poor sleep, inadequate protein, or inconsistent training.

### Hydration Is Simple
Drink water when you are thirsty. Drink more when you train, when it is hot, or when your urine is dark. For most training sessions under 60-90 minutes, water is sufficient — you do not need electrolyte drinks. For prolonged or high-sweat sessions, adding sodium (a pinch of salt in water, or an electrolyte tab) can help. The ISSN notes that even mild dehydration (2% body weight) can impair performance.
