# Cardio & Conditioning

Cardiovascular training improves the efficiency of your heart, lungs, and circulatory system. It reduces the risk of heart disease, improves metabolic health, supports mental wellbeing, and enhances recovery between strength training sessions. The ACSM recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week. But the most important principle is this: not everyone needs to run. Find a form of cardio you actually enjoy — walking, cycling, swimming, rowing, hiking, dancing — because the best cardio program is the one you will do consistently.

## Key Concepts

### Zone 2: The Foundation of Aerobic Health
Zone 2 training — roughly 60-70% of maximum heart rate, where you can hold a conversation but it feels like purposeful effort — is the single most impactful cardio investment for long-term health. It builds mitochondrial density, improves fat utilization, lowers resting heart rate, and creates the aerobic base that supports all other intensities. Dr. Peter Attia and exercise physiologist Iñigo San Millán have popularized this concept, but the science has been established for decades in endurance sport. Aim for 3-4 sessions of 30-60 minutes per week as a baseline.

### The 80/20 Principle
Elite endurance athletes spend roughly 80% of their training time at low intensity (Zones 1-2) and only 20% at high intensity (Zones 4-5). Recreational exercisers often invert this ratio, going moderately hard every session. This "moderate intensity rut" produces less adaptation than polarizing your training: go easy on easy days, go hard on hard days, and skip the middle most of the time.

### HIIT Is a Tool, Not the Whole Toolbox
High-intensity interval training is time-efficient and effective — but it is also fatiguing. Two to three HIIT sessions per week is a reasonable maximum for most people. More than that, and you risk overreaching, especially if combined with heavy strength training. HIIT complements a base of steady-state cardio; it does not replace it.

### Cardio and Strength Are Not Enemies
The "interference effect" — the idea that cardio kills gains — is overstated for most recreational trainees. Moderate amounts of cardio improve recovery between sets and sessions, support cardiovascular health, and do not meaningfully impair hypertrophy or strength when programmed sensibly. Separate cardio and lifting by at least 6 hours when possible, or do cardio on non-lifting days.
