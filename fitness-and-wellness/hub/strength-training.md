# Strength Training Fundamentals

Strength training is the practice of using resistance to build muscular strength, endurance, and size. Whether you use barbells, dumbbells, machines, or bodyweight, the underlying principles are the same: challenge your muscles progressively, recover adequately, and stay consistent. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) both recommend resistance training at least two days per week for general health, with more frequent training for those pursuing specific performance or physique goals.

## Key Concepts

### Compound Movements First
The squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, and row variations form the foundation of effective strength programs. These multi-joint exercises train the most muscle mass per movement, produce the strongest hormonal response, and transfer to real-world activities. Isolation work has its place, but it supplements — not replaces — compound lifts.

### Progressive Overload
Your body adapts to the demands you place on it. To keep getting stronger, you must progressively increase the challenge over time. For beginners, this often means adding small amounts of weight each session. For intermediate and advanced trainees, progression becomes more nuanced — adding reps before weight, increasing total volume, or manipulating training density.

### Recovery Between Sessions
Muscles grow during recovery, not during the workout itself. The NSCA recommends 48-72 hours between training the same muscle group for most populations. Sleep, nutrition, and stress management are not optional extras — they are part of the training program. Consistently training hard on poor sleep and inadequate nutrition is a recipe for stagnation and injury.

### Volume, Intensity, and Frequency
These three variables form the core of program design. Volume is total work (sets x reps x weight). Intensity is how heavy the load is relative to your maximum. Frequency is how often you train a muscle group per week. Research suggests that spreading volume across 2-3 sessions per muscle group per week may be superior to a single high-volume session, especially for hypertrophy (Schoenfeld et al., 2016).

## Guidelines References

- **ACSM**: Recommends 2-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions for each major muscle group, 2-3 days per week, with at least 48 hours between sessions targeting the same muscle group.
- **NSCA**: Emphasizes periodized programming, progressive overload, and the principle of specificity — train the way you want to adapt.
