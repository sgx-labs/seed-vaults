# Overtraining Signs: Recognizing When You Are Doing Too Much

## The Question

How do you tell the difference between normal training fatigue and overtraining, and what do you do about it?

## The Overtraining Continuum

True overtraining syndrome (OTS) is a clinical condition that takes months to develop and months to recover from. It is rare in recreational trainees. What is common is **overreaching** — doing too much too fast without adequate recovery. The continuum looks like this:

### 1. Functional Overreaching (Normal)
A planned, short-term increase in training load that temporarily decreases performance. After a deload or rest period, performance rebounds to a higher level than before. This is actually how periodized training works — push hard, recover, come back stronger.

- **Duration:** Days to 1-2 weeks
- **Recovery:** 1 deload week
- **Outcome:** Positive (supercompensation)

### 2. Non-Functional Overreaching (Warning Zone)
An unplanned accumulation of training stress that decreases performance and takes longer than expected to recover from. The body is sending clear signals that something needs to change, but no lasting harm has occurred yet.

- **Duration:** 2-4 weeks of declining performance
- **Recovery:** 2-4 weeks of reduced training
- **Outcome:** Neutral (return to baseline, not a new peak)

### 3. Overtraining Syndrome (Clinical)
Prolonged performance decrement accompanied by systemic symptoms. The neuroendocrine system is disrupted. Recovery can take months. This requires medical attention.

- **Duration:** Months
- **Recovery:** Months, sometimes longer
- **Outcome:** Negative (significant setback)

Most lifters who think they are "overtrained" are actually in the non-functional overreaching zone. The distinction matters because the interventions are different: non-functional overreaching needs rest and adjustment; overtraining syndrome may need medical evaluation.

## Warning Signs

### Performance Indicators
- **Decreased strength** that persists for 2+ sessions (not just one bad day — everyone has those)
- **Inability to complete previously manageable workouts** — weights that were comfortable now feel maximal
- **Slower recovery between sets** — you need more rest to feel ready for the next set
- **Decreased endurance** — cardiovascular performance declines alongside strength

### Physical Indicators
- **Persistent fatigue** that does not improve with a good night of sleep. You wake up tired.
- **Increased resting heart rate** — a reliable early indicator. If your resting HR is consistently 5-10 bpm higher than normal, your body is under excessive stress. (Track resting HR first thing in the morning, before getting out of bed.)
- **Frequent illness** — the immune system is suppressed by excessive training stress. If you are catching colds more often than usual, overreaching may be a factor.
- **Chronic joint pain** — soreness that does not resolve between sessions, particularly in the same locations. This is different from DOMS (which resolves in 24-72 hours).
- **Disrupted sleep** — paradoxically, overreaching can impair sleep quality despite feeling exhausted. Difficulty falling asleep, frequent waking, or unrefreshing sleep.

### Psychological Indicators
- **Mood disturbances** — irritability, anxiety, or depression that correlates with training load. Exercise normally improves mood; when it starts worsening mood, something is wrong.
- **Loss of motivation** — not just "I don't feel like going today" (which is normal) but a sustained, uncharacteristic lack of interest in training.
- **Difficulty concentrating** outside the gym — brain fog, decreased work performance
- **Feeling of dread** before training sessions that you used to enjoy

## What Causes Overreaching

It is rarely just one factor. The most common pattern is a combination of:

1. **Too much volume too fast.** Increasing weekly sets by more than 10-20% from one block to the next.
2. **Insufficient recovery.** Training 6-7 days per week without adequate sleep or nutrition.
3. **Ignoring life stress.** Training stress and life stress draw from the same recovery pool. Job stress, relationship problems, poor sleep, and illness all count.
4. **No deloads.** Training hard for 8, 10, 12+ weeks without a planned reduction in volume.
5. **Under-eating.** A caloric deficit (intentional or not) reduces recovery capacity significantly. Combining hard training with aggressive dieting is a recipe for overreaching.

## What to Do

### Step 1: Take a Full Rest Week
No structured training. Walk, stretch, do light activity. Sleep as much as possible. Eat at maintenance calories or above, with adequate protein.

### Step 2: Reduce Volume on Return
When you come back, start at 50-60% of your pre-overreaching volume. Rebuild gradually over 2-3 weeks.

### Step 3: Assess Your Programming
- Are you doing too many sets per week?
- Are you training too many days without rest?
- Are you including regular deload weeks?
- Is your nutrition supporting your training load?

### Step 4: Manage Total Stress
Training is one stressor among many. During high life-stress periods, reduce training volume rather than adding more. Your body does not distinguish between sources of stress.

### Step 5: When to See a Doctor
If symptoms persist for more than 2-3 weeks despite rest and reduced training:
- Get blood work done (testosterone, cortisol, thyroid function, iron levels, CBC)
- Rule out underlying medical conditions
- Consider working with a sports medicine physician or sports psychologist

Persistent fatigue, mood disturbances, and performance decrements can also indicate depression, thyroid dysfunction, anemia, or other medical conditions unrelated to training.

## Prevention

The best treatment for overreaching is not needing it in the first place:

- **Program deloads every 4-6 weeks** (see the deload-and-rest note)
- **Track resting heart rate** as an early warning system
- **Autoregulate intensity** — use RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) or RIR (Reps In Reserve) to adjust daily loads based on how you feel
- **Sleep 7-9 hours per night**
- **Eat enough** — especially protein and total calories
- **Build in rest days** — at least 2 per week for most people
- **Reduce training during high-stress life periods** proactively, not reactively
