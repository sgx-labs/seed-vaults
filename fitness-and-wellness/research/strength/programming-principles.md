# Programming Principles: Structuring Training Over Time

> **Disclaimer:** This content is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. Consult a physician before starting any exercise program. Stop any exercise that causes sharp pain. See a qualified professional for injuries or medical conditions.

## The Question

How do you organize training across a week and across months to make consistent progress?

## The Three Variables

Every training program manipulates three variables. Understanding them gives you the ability to read any program and understand why it is structured the way it is.

### Volume (How Much)
Total work performed, typically measured as sets per muscle group per week. Volume is the primary driver of hypertrophy (Schoenfeld et al., 2017).

- **Minimum effective volume:** ~6-8 sets per muscle group per week for trained individuals
- **Optimal range for most:** 10-20 sets per muscle group per week
- **Maximum recoverable volume:** Highly individual, but exceeding ~25+ sets per week per muscle group tends to produce diminishing returns and recovery issues
- **Key principle:** Start at the lower end and add volume over time. You cannot start at your maximum and still progress — you have nowhere to go.

### Intensity (How Hard)
Can mean either load (percentage of 1-rep max) or effort (proximity to failure).

- **For strength:** Work in the 1-5 rep range at 80-90%+ of 1RM. Heavier loads with full recovery between sets.
- **For hypertrophy:** The 6-15 rep range at 60-80% of 1RM is the traditional recommendation, but recent research (Schoenfeld et al., 2021) shows that a wide rep range works as long as sets are taken close to failure.
- **Proximity to failure matters more than exact percentages.** Training 1-3 reps from failure (RIR — Reps In Reserve) appears to be the sweet spot: hard enough to stimulate adaptation, not so hard that it destroys recovery.

### Frequency (How Often)
How many times per week you train each muscle group.

- **Schoenfeld et al. (2016)** meta-analysis: Training each muscle group **2x per week** produces significantly more hypertrophy than 1x per week at the same total volume.
- **2-3x per week per muscle group** is optimal for most people. Beyond 3x offers diminishing returns for hypertrophy, though higher frequency can work for strength skill development.
- **Frequency is a tool for distributing volume.** If you need 16 sets of chest per week, it is better as 8 sets on Monday + 8 on Thursday than 16 sets on Monday.

## Periodization: Organizing Training Over Time

### Linear Periodization (Best for Beginners)
Progress in a straight line: add weight each session or each week. Simple, effective, and works for as long as it works (typically 3-6 months for a true beginner).

Example: Squat starts at 95 lbs, add 5 lbs per session. After 12 weeks: 155 lbs.

### Undulating Periodization (Best for Intermediates)
Vary the rep range and intensity within a training week. This exposes the body to different stimuli and prevents staleness.

Example weekly structure:
- **Monday:** Heavy — Squat 4x3 at 85%
- **Wednesday:** Moderate — Squat 3x8 at 70%
- **Friday:** Light — Squat 3x12 at 60%

Research by Rhea et al. (2002) showed daily undulating periodization produced greater strength gains than linear periodization in trained subjects.

### Block Periodization (Best for Advanced)
Organize training into 3-6 week blocks, each with a specific focus:
- **Block 1 — Accumulation:** High volume, moderate intensity. Build work capacity and muscle.
- **Block 2 — Transmutation:** Moderate volume, higher intensity. Convert size to strength.
- **Block 3 — Realization:** Low volume, peak intensity. Express maximum performance.
- **Deload:** Recover before starting the next cycle.

This is how most competitive athletes and experienced lifters train.

## Common Program Structures

### Full Body (3x/week)
Every session trains the whole body. Best for beginners and those with 3 training days available. Each muscle group gets trained 3x per week with lower per-session volume.

### Upper/Lower Split (4x/week)
Two upper body days, two lower body days. Each muscle group trained 2x per week. Good balance of frequency and volume for intermediates.

Example: Upper Monday, Lower Tuesday, Rest Wednesday, Upper Thursday, Lower Friday.

### Push/Pull/Legs (3-6x/week)
Push (chest, shoulders, triceps), Pull (back, biceps), Legs. Can be run 3x/week (each once) or 6x/week (each twice). Very popular and effective for intermediate to advanced.

### The Bro Split (1x/week per muscle group)
Monday Chest, Tuesday Back, Wednesday Legs, etc. Each muscle trained once per week. Research suggests this is suboptimal compared to higher frequency at the same volume, but it has produced results for decades and is better than not training.

## The Principle of Diminishing Returns

Beginner gains are dramatic: strength can double in the first year. Intermediate progress is measured in months. Advanced progress is measured in years. This is not failure — this is biology.

Practical implication: the more advanced you are, the more carefully you need to program. A beginner can do almost anything and grow. An advanced trainee needs precise manipulation of volume, intensity, and recovery.

## The Most Important Principle

Consistency over optimization. A mediocre program followed consistently for years will produce better results than the "perfect" program followed for three weeks before you switch to the next one. Pick a sensible structure, follow it for at least 8-12 weeks, then evaluate and adjust.
