# Squat Technique: Barbell Back Squat Form Guide

## The Question

How do you perform a barbell back squat safely and effectively, and what are the most common mistakes to fix?

## Setup

### Bar Position
- **High bar** (on the traps, across upper back): More upright torso, greater knee flexion. Favored by Olympic lifters and most general trainees.
- **Low bar** (on the rear deltoids, across the spine of the scapula): More hip hinge, greater forward lean. Allows most people to lift slightly more weight. Common in powerlifting.

Neither is "better." High bar is more intuitive for most beginners.

### Grip and Unracking
- Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder width. Wrists should be relatively straight, not bent back under the bar.
- Step under the bar, set it in position, brace your core, and stand up with the bar.
- Take 2-3 steps back. No more. Feet approximately shoulder-width apart, toes turned out 15-30 degrees.

## The Descent

1. **Brace first** — take a deep breath into your belly (360-degree expansion around your midsection), tighten your core as if bracing for a punch. This is the Valsalva maneuver and it stabilizes your spine under load.
2. **Initiate with hips and knees simultaneously** — think "sit down between your legs," not "sit back" (sitting too far back is a low-bar cue that confuses high-bar squatters).
3. **Knee tracking** — your knees should track over your toes. It is perfectly safe for your knees to travel past your toes. The old advice "never let your knees go past your toes" has been thoroughly debunked. A 2003 study by Fry et al. showed that restricting forward knee travel increases hip and low-back stress.
4. **Depth** — for full range of motion, descend until your hip crease passes below the top of your knee. If you cannot reach this depth, work on ankle and hip mobility rather than loading heavy at partial range.

## Common Mistakes and Fixes

### Butt Wink
The pelvis tucks under at the bottom of the squat, rounding the lower back. Causes include limited hip or ankle mobility, bony anatomy (hip socket depth and angle vary between individuals), and going deeper than your mobility allows under load.

- **When it matters:** Under heavy load, significant butt wink puts the lumbar spine in flexion, increasing disc injury risk. A small amount of pelvic movement is normal and not dangerous.
- **Fixes:** Goblet squat with a slow descent to groove the pattern. Hip mobility work (90/90s, hip CARs). Widen your stance slightly. Elevate your heels (squat shoes or small plates).

### Knee Cave (Valgus)
Knees collapsing inward during the ascent. Often a glute activation or motor control issue rather than pure weakness.
- **Fixes:** Cue "spread the floor with your feet." Use a light band around the knees during warm-up sets for feedback. Strengthen glutes with hip thrusts and lateral band walks.

### Excessive Forward Lean
Chest drops toward the floor. Common with weak quads or poor thoracic mobility.
- **Fixes:** Front squats and goblet squats build the upright pattern. Thoracic extension work. Strengthen quads with leg press or belt squat.

## The Goblet Squat: Your Best Learning Tool

Before touching a barbell, spend 2-4 weeks with goblet squats. Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell at chest height, sit down between your legs. The front-loaded weight naturally teaches upright torso, proper depth, and knee tracking. If you can goblet squat 40+ lbs for sets of 10 with good form, you are ready for the barbell.

## The Ascent

1. **Drive up out of the bottom** — push the floor away with your whole foot. Do not shift to your toes.
2. **Keep your chest up** — the bar, your shoulders, and your hips should all rise at the same rate. If your hips rise first and the bar stays low, the lift turns into a good morning. Cue "chest up" or "elbows under the bar."
3. **Drive your back into the bar** — on heavy sets, think about pushing the bar up with your back rather than standing up with your legs. This keeps the torso angle constant.
4. **Finish with your hips** — squeeze your glutes at the top and stand fully tall. Do not hyperextend.

## Breathing and Bracing Between Reps

For sets of 5 or fewer at heavy weight: brace at the top, descend, ascend, exhale and re-brace at the top before the next rep. Do not breathe at the bottom of the squat — this is the weakest and most vulnerable position.

For higher rep sets (8-12+): you may need to take a quick breath at the top between reps. Maintain partial bracing even while breathing — do not completely relax your midsection.

## Stance Width and Individual Variation

There is no single correct squat stance. Body proportions (femur length, torso length, hip socket angle) significantly affect optimal stance width and toe angle. General guidelines:

- **Start with feet shoulder-width apart, toes turned out 15-30 degrees**
- **Experiment wider:** If you have long femurs or feel cramped at the bottom, a wider stance may improve depth
- **Experiment narrower:** Some people feel strongest with a more narrow stance, particularly for high-bar squats
- **The right stance is the one where you can reach full depth with a neutral spine, no pain, and the most stability**

Film yourself from multiple angles and compare. What feels correct and what looks correct are often different, especially for beginners.

## Modifications for Limited Mobility

- **Limited ankle mobility:** Elevate heels on small plates or invest in squat shoes (raised heel). This is not cheating — it is a legitimate tool.
- **Limited hip mobility:** Widen stance, turn toes out more, use a box or bench as a depth target and work toward getting lower over weeks.
- **Shoulder or wrist pain holding the bar:** Use a wider grip, try a safety squat bar if available, or stick with goblet squats and leg press.

## Programming Notes

- **Beginners:** Squat 3x per week (full body program). Sets of 5 at progressively heavier weight.
- **Intermediates:** Squat 2-3x per week. Vary intensity — one heavy day (3x3-5), one moderate day (3x8).
- **Warm-up properly:** Empty bar for 10 reps, then progressively heavier doubles and singles up to working weight.
- **Film yourself:** Video from the side and from 45 degrees behind. Review weekly. You will catch form issues that you cannot feel.
