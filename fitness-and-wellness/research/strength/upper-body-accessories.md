# Upper Body Accessories: Supplemental Exercises for Balanced Development

> **Disclaimer:** This content is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. Consult a physician before starting any exercise program. Stop any exercise that causes sharp pain. See a qualified professional for injuries or medical conditions.

## The Question

What supplemental upper body exercises should you add to a compound-focused program, and why?

## Why Accessories Matter

Compound movements (bench press, overhead press, rows) are the foundation. They train the most muscle mass with the fewest exercises. But they have blind spots. Accessories fill the gaps:

- Target muscles that compounds under-train (rear deltoids, biceps, direct tricep work)
- Address imbalances that lead to injury (especially push/pull ratio)
- Add hypertrophy-focused volume that compounds alone may not provide
- Strengthen weak links that limit compound performance

## The Pull/Push Balance Rule

One of the most important principles for upper body health: your weekly pulling volume should at least match your pressing volume. Many trainees press far more than they pull, which creates shoulder internal rotation dominance and impingement risk.

A practical rule: for every set of pressing (bench, overhead press, push-ups), do at least one set of pulling (rows, pull-ups, face pulls). If you have shoulder issues, bias toward more pulling.

## Essential Accessories

### Pull-Ups and Chin-Ups
The king of upper body pulling movements. Trains lats, biceps, forearms, and core.

- **Pull-up** (palms away): More lat emphasis, harder for most people
- **Chin-up** (palms toward you): More bicep involvement, usually easier to start with
- **Cannot do a pull-up yet?** Use these progressions:
  1. Lat pulldown machine (build baseline strength)
  2. Band-assisted pull-ups (loop a resistance band over the bar, step into it)
  3. Negatives (jump to the top, lower yourself as slowly as possible for 3-5 seconds)
  4. Full pull-ups (even if it is just 1 rep — accumulate singles)
- **Programming:** 3-4 sets to near failure, 2-3x per week. Add weight via a dip belt when bodyweight becomes manageable for 3x10+.

### Dumbbell Rows
Excellent for building a thick upper back and addressing side-to-side imbalances.
- One arm at a time, other hand and knee on a bench
- Pull the dumbbell toward your hip, not straight up to your armpit
- Full stretch at the bottom, squeeze at the top
- **Programming:** 3 sets of 8-12 reps per side

### Face Pulls
The single best exercise for shoulder health that most people do not do.
- Cable machine or resistance band at face height
- Pull toward your face, separating your hands at the end (external rotation)
- Targets rear deltoids and rotator cuff muscles
- **Programming:** 3 sets of 15-20 reps, 2-3x per week. Light weight, high reps. This is prehab, not ego work.

### Lateral Raises
Develops the medial (side) deltoid, which gives shoulders width and is under-stimulated by pressing alone.
- Dumbbells or cables, raise to the side until arms are roughly parallel to the floor
- Slight forward lean to target the medial head better
- Control the descent — do not just drop the weight
- **Programming:** 3-4 sets of 10-15 reps. Light weight. Most people go too heavy and use momentum.

### Tricep Pushdowns (or Overhead Extensions)
The triceps make up roughly two-thirds of upper arm mass and are the prime movers in the lockout of bench and overhead press.
- Cable pushdowns: elbows pinned to sides, extend arms fully, squeeze at the bottom
- Overhead cable or dumbbell extensions: stretch the long head of the tricep, which is not fully trained by pressing alone
- **Programming:** 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps

### Bicep Curls
Often dismissed as "vanity work," but bicep strength supports pulling movements and helps protect the elbow joint.
- Barbell curls, dumbbell curls, or hammer curls (palms neutral — also trains the brachialis and forearms)
- Full range of motion — extend all the way down, curl all the way up
- **Programming:** 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps. No need for excessive volume — the biceps get significant work from all pulling movements.

## Programming Accessories Into Your Week

### After Compounds
Perform accessories after your main compound lifts for the day. A typical session:
1. Main compound lift: 3-5 heavy sets (bench, overhead press, or rows)
2. Supporting compound: 3 sets (e.g., dumbbell press after barbell bench)
3. Accessories: 2-4 exercises, 2-3 sets each, 8-15 reps

### Supersets for Efficiency
Pair non-competing exercises to save time:
- Bench press superset with dumbbell rows (push + pull)
- Lateral raises superset with bicep curls (different muscle groups)
- Tricep pushdowns superset with face pulls

Rest 60-90 seconds between supersets. This cuts workout time significantly with minimal performance cost.

### Weekly Example
| Day | Compounds | Accessories |
|-----|-----------|------------|
| Monday | Bench Press, Barbell Row | Face Pulls, Tricep Pushdowns, Curls |
| Wednesday | Squat, Overhead Press | Lateral Raises, Pull-Ups |
| Friday | Deadlift, Dumbbell Bench | Dumbbell Rows, Face Pulls, Curls |

## The Minimum

If you can only pick three accessories for upper body health and development: pull-ups, face pulls, and curls. These address the most common imbalances and support the big lifts.
