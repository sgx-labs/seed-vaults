# Bench Press Technique: Barbell Bench Press Form Guide

## The Question

How do you bench press safely and effectively, and how do you set up to protect your shoulders?

## Setup: The Foundation

A good bench press starts before you touch the bar. Sloppy setup is the root cause of most shoulder issues and missed reps.

1. **Position on the bench** — Lie back so your eyes are directly under the bar. Your head, upper back, and glutes all stay on the bench throughout the lift.
2. **Retract your shoulder blades** — Pull your shoulder blades together and down, as if trying to pinch a pencil between them. Press them into the bench. This creates a stable platform and protects your shoulders. This is the single most important bench press cue.
3. **The arch** — A slight arch in your lower back is natural and protective. It shortens the range of motion and keeps your shoulders in a safer position. You are not trying to bridge like a gymnast — just maintain the natural curve of your spine. A flat back on the bench actually puts shoulders at greater risk.
4. **Feet** — Plant them flat on the floor, slightly behind your knees. Drive through the floor for stability (leg drive). If your feet do not reach the floor, use plates or mats under them.
5. **Grip width** — When the bar is at your chest, your forearms should be roughly vertical. For most people this is slightly wider than shoulder width. Too narrow overloads the triceps; too wide puts excessive stress on the shoulders.

## The Press

1. **Unrack** — With arms locked, pull the bar out over your shoulders (not over your face). A spotter can help with the handoff, which saves energy.
2. **Lower the bar** — Controlled descent to your chest. Touch point varies by build — generally between the nipple line and the lower sternum. The bar path is slightly diagonal, not straight up and down.
3. **Elbow angle** — Tuck your elbows to approximately 45 degrees from your torso. Flaring the elbows to 90 degrees is the fastest route to shoulder impingement. Think about "bending the bar" toward your feet.
4. **Touch the chest** — The bar should gently touch your chest, not bounce off it. A brief pause is good practice.
5. **Drive up** — Press the bar up and slightly back toward the rack. The bar path follows a slight arc. Lock out your elbows at the top.

## Common Mistakes

### Losing Shoulder Blade Retraction
If your shoulders round forward during the press, you lose stability and shoulder protection. Reset between sets if needed. Think "chest up, shoulders back" before every rep.

### Bouncing Off the Chest
Slamming the bar into your chest to generate momentum is both dangerous (cracked sternum risk with heavy weight) and less effective. Control the descent, touch, then drive.

### Flared Elbows
Elbows at 90 degrees creates maximum stress on the shoulder joint. Keep them at 45-75 degrees. This feels less powerful at first but protects your shoulders and actually engages more pec.

### Uneven Press
One arm extending faster than the other. Usually a strength imbalance. Address with dumbbell bench pressing for a training cycle to let the weak side catch up.

### Lifting Hips Off the Bench
Driving the hips up shortens the range of motion and is technically a disqualification in competition. It usually means the weight is too heavy. Keep your glutes on the bench.

## The Dumbbell Bench Press Alternative

Dumbbells offer several advantages:
- Greater range of motion (the bar does not stop you at chest height)
- Each arm works independently, fixing imbalances
- Easier to bail safely (drop the dumbbells to the sides)
- No spotter required

Disadvantages: harder to load progressively (gym dumbbells go up in 5-10 lb jumps) and harder to stabilize. Use dumbbells as a primary pressing movement or as a supplemental exercise to the barbell bench.

## Training Without a Spotter

Never bench press to failure without a way to escape the bar. Options:

- **Safety pins or spotter arms** — Set them just below chest height. If you fail, lower the bar to the pins.
- **The roll of shame** — Lower the bar to your chest, roll it down your torso to your hips, sit up. Not ideal but functional. Practice with light weight.
- **Dumbbells** — Use dumbbells instead if training alone frequently.
- **Ask for a spot** — Most gym-goers are happy to help. Tell them: "Don't touch the bar unless I say 'help' or you see it moving downward."

## Spotter Protocol

If you are spotting someone:
- Stand behind the bench, hands near (but not on) the bar
- Follow the bar with your hands but do not touch it unless they ask or the bar starts descending
- If assisting, provide the minimum force needed — help them finish the rep, do not row the bar off their chest
- Agree on signals before the set begins

## Programming Notes

- Bench press responds well to moderate volume: 3-5 sets of 3-8 reps for strength
- Most people bench 2x per week (one heavy, one lighter/variation)
- Close-grip bench press is an excellent tricep-focused variation
- Incline bench press (15-30 degrees) emphasizes the upper chest and front deltoids
