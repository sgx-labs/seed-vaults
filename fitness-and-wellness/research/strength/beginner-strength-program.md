# Beginner Strength Program: Full-Body 3x/Week

> **Disclaimer:** This content is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. Consult a physician before starting any exercise program. Stop any exercise that causes sharp pain. See a qualified professional for injuries or medical conditions.

## The Question

What is a simple, effective strength program for someone who has never lifted weights before?

## The Program

This is a full-body program performed three days per week (e.g., Monday/Wednesday/Friday) with at least one rest day between sessions. It prioritizes compound movements that train multiple muscle groups simultaneously.

### Workout A
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest |
|----------|------------|------|
| Barbell Squat (or Goblet Squat) | 3 x 5 | 2-3 min |
| Barbell Bench Press (or Dumbbell Press) | 3 x 5 | 2-3 min |
| Barbell Row (or Dumbbell Row) | 3 x 8 | 2 min |

### Workout B
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Rest |
|----------|------------|------|
| Barbell Squat (or Goblet Squat) | 3 x 5 | 2-3 min |
| Overhead Press (Barbell or Dumbbell) | 3 x 5 | 2-3 min |
| Deadlift (or Romanian Deadlift) | 1 x 5 | 3 min |

Alternate A and B each session: Week 1 = A/B/A, Week 2 = B/A/B, and so on.

## Warm-Up Protocol

Before every session:
1. **5 minutes light cardio** — bike, brisk walk, or jump rope to raise core temperature
2. **Dynamic movements** — leg swings, arm circles, bodyweight squats (10 reps)
3. **Ramp-up sets** — for each exercise, perform 1-2 lighter sets before your working weight. For example, if your working squat is 95 lbs, do a set with the empty bar (45 lbs) and a set at 75 lbs first

## Linear Progression

The core principle: when you complete all prescribed sets and reps with good form, add weight next session.

- **Squat and Deadlift:** Add 5 lbs per session
- **Bench Press and Overhead Press:** Add 5 lbs per session (switch to 2.5 lb increments when progress slows — microplates are worth buying)
- **Rows:** Add 5 lbs per session

If you fail to complete all reps at a weight for two consecutive sessions, reduce the weight by 10-15% and work back up. This is normal and expected.

## Timeline and Expectations

- **Weeks 1-2:** Focus entirely on form. Use light weight. This is not wasted time — it is building the movement patterns that will support heavy loads later.
- **Months 1-3:** Rapid strength gains. This is the "novice effect" — your nervous system is learning to recruit muscle fibers efficiently. Enjoy it.
- **Months 3-6:** Gains slow but are still consistent. You are building real tissue now.
- **After 6 months:** Linear progression stalls. This is normal. You are no longer a beginner and can transition to an intermediate program.

## Dumbbell Alternatives

No barbell? Every movement has a dumbbell version:
- Barbell Squat → Goblet Squat (hold a dumbbell at chest height)
- Bench Press → Dumbbell Bench Press
- Overhead Press → Dumbbell Overhead Press (seated or standing)
- Barbell Row → Single-Arm Dumbbell Row
- Deadlift → Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift

You will outgrow dumbbells faster than barbells for lower body, but this gets you started.

## Where This Comes From

This structure draws on frameworks like Mark Rippetoe's Starting Strength and Mehdi's StrongLifts 5x5, both of which have helped hundreds of thousands of beginners build foundational strength. Those programs differ in details (Starting Strength uses power cleans, StrongLifts uses 5x5 instead of 3x5) but share the same philosophy: compound movements, linear progression, full-body frequency.

This is ONE valid approach. Other beginner programs (GZCLP, 5/3/1 for Beginners, various PPL splits) also work. The best program is one you will actually do consistently.

## Common Beginner Mistakes

1. **Starting too heavy** — leave ego at the door. Start with the empty bar or light dumbbells.
2. **Skipping sessions** — consistency beats perfection. Three sessions per week, every week.
3. **Changing programs every 2 weeks** — pick one and run it for at least 3 months.
4. **Ignoring nutrition** — you cannot build strength without adequate protein and calories (see the nutrition research notes).
5. **Comparing to others** — your only competition is your last session.
