## The Question

How do you perform a conventional deadlift safely and effectively, and what variations exist for different goals?

## Setup: The Five-Step Process

The deadlift is the simplest lift conceptually — pick the bar up off the floor — but the setup determines everything.

1. **Feet** — Stand with feet hip-width apart (narrower than your squat stance). The bar should be over your mid-foot, about 1 inch from your shins. This feels very close. It should.
2. **Grip** — Bend over and grip the bar just outside your legs. Double overhand grip to start. Arms straight, no bend at the elbows.
3. **Shins to bar** — Bend your knees forward until your shins touch the bar. Do not move the bar. It stays over mid-foot.
4. **Chest up** — Without dropping your hips, lift your chest. This sets your back into a neutral position. You should feel tension in your hamstrings.
5. **Pull** — Push the floor away with your legs while keeping the bar tight to your body.

## The Pull

- **Think "push the floor away"** rather than "pull the bar up." This keeps you driving with your legs instead of yanking with your back.
- **Bar path** — the bar should travel in a straight vertical line, staying in contact with or very close to your body the entire time. If it drifts forward, you lose leverage and your back takes over.
- **Lockout** — stand up tall by driving your hips forward. Squeeze your glutes at the top. Do not hyperextend your lower back — a straight, vertical spine at lockout is the goal.
- **The descent** — hinge at the hips first (push your butt back), then bend your knees once the bar passes them. Control the weight down — do not drop it recklessly, but you do not need to lower it in slow motion either.

## Common Mistakes

### Rounding the Lower Back
The most frequently discussed deadlift error. A rounded lower back under heavy load increases shear force on the lumbar spine.
- **Fix:** Set up correctly (Step 4 above is critical). If you cannot maintain a neutral spine with a given weight, the weight is too heavy. Film yourself from the side to check.
- **Note:** Some upper back rounding is acceptable and even normal in very heavy pulls. Lower back rounding is the concern.

### Bar Drifting Forward
If the bar moves away from your body, your lower back becomes a long lever arm. This is inefficient and risky.
- **Fix:** Cue "drag the bar up your legs." Wearing long socks or pants protects your shins. Keep your lats engaged — cue "protect your armpits" or "bend the bar around your legs."

### Hips Shooting Up First
Your hips rise but the bar does not move, turning the deadlift into a stiff-leg pull.
- **Fix:** Your hips and shoulders should rise at the same rate. Cue "push the floor away" and ensure you are not starting with your hips too low (a common over-correction).

### Hitching
Using your thighs to bounce the bar up during the lockout. This is inefficient and illegal in competition.
- **Fix:** Strengthen the lockout with block pulls or rack pulls. Improve glute drive at the top.

## Grip Options

- **Double overhand** — use this as long as possible. It trains grip strength and is the safest grip. Use chalk.
- **Mixed grip** (one palm forward, one back) — allows heavier loads but creates asymmetric loading on the biceps. Alternate which hand is supinated between sets.
- **Hook grip** — thumbs under fingers. Hurts initially but becomes tolerable. Used by Olympic lifters and many powerlifters. Symmetric loading.
- **Straps** — use them for heavy working sets once grip becomes the limiting factor. There is no shame in straps. Your back and legs are stronger than your grip — train the movement, not just your grip.

## The Sumo Variation

Feet wide, hands inside the knees. Reduces the range of motion and changes the demand: more quads and adductors, less lower back. Neither sumo nor conventional is "better" — it depends on your build, mobility, and preference. People with longer torsos and shorter arms often prefer sumo. Try both.

## The Romanian Deadlift (RDL)

A top-down hip hinge with slight knee bend. The bar never touches the floor. Excellent hamstring and glute developer. Lower the bar until you feel a strong stretch in your hamstrings (usually mid-shin), then drive hips forward to return. Use lighter loads than conventional and focus on the stretch-contract. Program as an accessory: 3 sets of 8-12 reps.

## Breathing and Bracing

The deadlift demands more bracing discipline than any other lift because the load is maximal and the lumbar spine is in a vulnerable position.

1. **Brace before you pull.** At the bottom, with your chest up and back set, take a deep breath into your abdomen (360-degree expansion) and lock it down.
2. **Hold the brace** for the entire rep — both the pull and the descent.
3. **Reset at the bottom.** On sets of 3-5, exhale and re-brace between each rep with the bar on the floor. Do not try to touch-and-go heavy deadlifts without resetting your brace — that is where form breaks down.

For heavy singles and doubles, the Valsalva maneuver is standard. If you have blood pressure concerns, consult a physician.

## When to Use a Belt

A lifting belt helps you brace more effectively by giving the abdominals something to push against. Guidelines:

- **Warm-up sets:** No belt. Build bracing strength unassisted.
- **Working sets above ~75-80% of 1RM:** Belt use is reasonable and recommended for many lifters.
- **A belt does not replace core strength.** If you cannot brace properly without a belt, practice bracing before relying on external support.
- **Belt width:** A uniform-width belt (4 inches all around) is standard for powerlifting-style deadlifts. Tapered belts (narrower in front) are less effective.

## Programming Notes

- **Start light.** An empty barbell or even lighter (use bumper plates to get the bar to the correct height, or deadlift off blocks).
- **Low reps for heavy work.** Deadlifts are fatiguing. Sets of 1-5 are standard for strength development.
- **Frequency.** Once or twice per week is sufficient for most trainees. The deadlift is systemically fatiguing — more is not always better.
- **Warm-up protocol:** Start with lighter sets (135 x 5, 185 x 3, 225 x 1, etc.) to practice setup and build to working weight. Each warm-up set is a chance to verify your positions.
- **Film from the side.** What you feel and what is actually happening are often different. Side-view video reveals back position, bar path, and hip rise timing clearly.
