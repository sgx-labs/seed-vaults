# Conditioning for Strength Athletes: Cardio That Supports Your Lifts

## The Question

Why should lifters do cardio, and how do you do it without hurting your strength gains?

## Why Lifters Need Conditioning

The anti-cardio attitude in strength training culture is understandable — many lifters saw running as the enemy of gains. But ignoring cardiovascular fitness entirely has real consequences:

### Work Capacity
Better conditioning means recovering faster between sets. If you are gasping after a set of 5 squats and need 5 minutes before you can go again, your aerobic system is the bottleneck. Improved cardiovascular fitness lets you handle more total training volume, which drives more strength and hypertrophy over time.

### Recovery Between Sessions
A well-conditioned cardiovascular system delivers more oxygen and nutrients to recovering muscles and removes metabolic waste more efficiently. Lifters with better aerobic fitness tend to recover faster between training days.

### Heart Health
Lifting weights provides some cardiovascular benefit, but it is not sufficient on its own. Resistance training without any aerobic work leaves significant gaps in cardiac health. Your heart is a muscle that benefits from sustained, moderate-intensity work — not just brief maximal efforts.

### General Physical Preparedness
Being strong but unable to climb three flights of stairs without breathing hard is a sign of incomplete fitness. Conditioning gives you the capacity to use your strength in the real world.

### Longevity
VO2max is one of the strongest predictors of all-cause mortality. Strength training alone does not maximize VO2max. Some dedicated cardiovascular work is necessary.

## Low-Impact Conditioning Options

The key for strength athletes is choosing conditioning methods that do not compete with recovery from heavy lifting. High-impact, high-volume running is the most likely to interfere. These alternatives provide cardiovascular stimulus with minimal interference.

### Sled Pushes and Pulls
The gold standard for lifter-friendly conditioning. Sleds are concentric-only (no eccentric loading), which means they do not cause significant muscle damage or soreness. You can push a sled hard and still squat the next day.

- **Protocol:** 6-10 pushes of 30-50 yards with 60-90 seconds rest
- **Load:** Heavy enough to be challenging, light enough to maintain speed
- **Frequency:** 1-2x per week

### Assault Bike (Air Bike) Intervals
The assault bike provides full-body conditioning with zero impact. The resistance automatically matches your effort — the harder you push, the harder it gets.

- **Protocol:** 10-15 seconds of all-out effort / 45-60 seconds of easy spinning × 8-10 rounds
- **Alternative:** 30-second moderate effort / 30-second easy × 10-15 rounds
- **Frequency:** 1-2x per week

### Loaded Carries (Farmer's Walks)
Pick up heavy dumbbells, kettlebells, or a trap bar and walk. Simple, effective, and directly transfers to strength training. Loaded carries train grip, core stability, shoulder stability, and cardiovascular endurance simultaneously.

- **Protocol:** Walk 40-60 yards, rest 60-90 seconds, repeat 4-6 times
- **Load:** Start with 50% of bodyweight per hand, progress to bodyweight per hand
- **Variations:** Single-arm carry (anti-lateral flexion), overhead carry (shoulder stability), zercher carry (front-loaded)
- **Frequency:** 1-2x per week, often as a training finisher

### Rowing Machine
Full-body, low-impact, and self-limiting (you cannot row beyond your capacity without form breaking down). The rowing machine provides excellent cardiac output training.

- **Protocol for steady-state:** 20-30 minutes at a pace where you can breathe through your nose or talk
- **Protocol for intervals:** 500m hard / 500m easy × 4-6 rounds
- **Frequency:** 1-2x per week

### Walking
The most underestimated conditioning tool for lifters. Walking is Zone 1-2 effort, promotes recovery, has zero interference with strength gains, and accumulates over a day. Many strength coaches prescribe 8,000-10,000 steps per day as a baseline.

- **Protocol:** 30-45 minutes daily, or 3-4 dedicated walks per week
- **Make it count:** Walk at a brisk pace, add an incline (treadmill or hills), or carry a light backpack (ruck)

## Programming Guidelines

### Volume
2-3 conditioning sessions per week of 20-30 minutes each is sufficient for most lifters. This provides cardiovascular benefit without encroaching on recovery.

### Timing
- **Ideal:** On separate days from heavy lifting (e.g., lift M/W/F, condition Tu/Th)
- **Acceptable:** After lifting, as a 10-15 minute finisher
- **Avoid:** Intense conditioning before lifting (reduces strength performance)

### What to Avoid
- **High-impact running on squat or deadlift days.** Eccentric loading from running fatigues the quads and hamstrings, impairing recovery.
- **Excessive volume.** 5x per week of 45-minute conditioning sessions on top of 4 days of heavy lifting is too much for most people.
- **Long slow distance running as your only cardio.** High mileage running has the most interference with hypertrophy (Hickson, 1980). Low-impact modalities are a better choice.

## Cardiac Output Training

A specific method popularized by Joel Jamieson: sustained, moderate-intensity work (120-150 bpm) for 30-60 minutes. The goal is to increase cardiac stroke volume — the amount of blood your heart pumps per beat. Over time this lowers resting heart rate and improves recovery capacity.

- Best done on a bike, rower, or elliptical (low impact)
- Keep heart rate in the prescribed zone — do not drift into tempo territory
- 1-2 sessions per week
- Benefits are gradual but profound over months

## The Practical Minimum

If you are a lifter who hates cardio and wants to do the bare minimum for health:
- Walk 30 minutes 4-5 days per week (steps throughout the day count)
- Do 1 dedicated conditioning session per week (sled work, bike intervals, or loaded carries for 15-20 minutes)

That is enough to support your lifting, protect your heart, and maintain general fitness.
