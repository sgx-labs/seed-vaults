# Steady-State Cardio: The Underrated Foundation

## The Question

Is steady-state cardio still worth doing in the age of HIIT, and if so, how should you approach it?

## Steady-State Is Not Dead

HIIT is time-efficient and effective. It makes for great marketing. But the narrative that "steady-state cardio is a waste of time" is wrong and has caused real harm by steering people away from the most sustainable and foundational form of cardiovascular exercise.

Here is the reality: elite endurance athletes spend 80% of their training time at low intensity. Cardiac rehabilitation programs are built on steady-state work. The longest-lived populations on earth do not do HIIT — they walk. A lot.

Steady-state cardio is any continuous aerobic exercise performed at a consistent, moderate intensity for 30-60+ minutes. Heart rate stays in Zone 2 (60-70% of max) — conversational pace.

## Benefits

### Physical Adaptations
- **Builds aerobic base:** Mitochondrial density, capillary growth, improved stroke volume. These adaptations support everything else — including your ability to recover from strength training.
- **Cardiac health:** Reduces resting heart rate, blood pressure, and risk of cardiovascular disease. The ACSM recommends 150-300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity.
- **Fat oxidation:** Zone 2 is where the body burns the highest proportion of fat for fuel. This improves metabolic flexibility.
- **Active recovery:** Enhances blood flow to muscles without adding significant stress. Promotes recovery between strength sessions.
- **Low injury risk:** Walking, cycling, and swimming are far less likely to cause injury than high-intensity or high-impact activities.

### Mental Health Benefits
- **Anxiety reduction:** Moderate aerobic exercise reduces state and trait anxiety (Stonerock et al., 2015). The effect is comparable to some first-line pharmaceutical interventions.
- **Depression management:** Regular aerobic exercise is one of the most effective non-pharmacological treatments for mild-to-moderate depression.
- **Cognitive function:** Steady-state cardio improves executive function, memory, and processing speed. These effects are particularly strong in older adults.
- **Stress relief:** The combination of rhythmic movement, time outdoors (if applicable), and distance from screens provides a mental reset that many people find irreplaceable.

## Forms of Steady-State Cardio

### Walking (Seriously Underrated)
Walking is the most accessible form of exercise on the planet. It requires no equipment, no gym membership, and no learning curve. 30-60 minutes of brisk walking qualifies as Zone 2 for many people, particularly those who are new to exercise or returning after a break.

8,000-10,000 steps per day is associated with significant reductions in all-cause mortality (Paluch et al., 2022). This is not a magic number — more is better up to a point, and any increase from a low baseline is beneficial.

### Jogging
Easy running at conversational pace. The key word is easy. Most recreational runners default to Zone 3 when they intend to run easy. Genuinely easy jogging should feel almost too slow.

### Cycling
Low-impact, adjustable intensity, and excellent for people with joint issues. Indoor cycling (stationary bike) is convenient and weather-proof. Outdoor cycling adds the mental health benefits of being outside.

### Swimming
Zero-impact, full-body, excellent for people with injuries or conditions that limit weight-bearing exercise. The main barrier is access to a pool and basic swim competency.

### Rowing Machine
Full-body, low-impact, and one of the best calorie-per-minute activities available. Proper rowing technique matters — spend time learning the catch-drive-finish-recovery sequence.

### Elliptical Machine
Low impact, mimics running motion. Not exciting, but effective and easy on the joints.

## How to Make It Not Boring

This is the real challenge. Steady-state cardio is not inherently stimulating, especially on indoor equipment. Strategies:

- **Podcasts and audiobooks:** This is the most common solution and it works. Many people look forward to their cardio specifically because of what they are listening to.
- **Outdoor routes:** Natural environments improve mood and make time pass faster. Vary your routes.
- **Social activity:** Walking or cycling with a friend, partner, or dog. The social component makes it sustainable.
- **Zone 2 training reframe:** Track your heart rate and resting heart rate over weeks. Watching your fitness improve quantitatively is motivating.
- **The "only during cardio" rule:** Reserve a show, podcast, or audiobook that you ONLY consume during cardio. Creates a positive association.

## Combining Steady-State With Strength Training

### Interference Effect
Concurrent training (combining strength and cardio) can interfere with strength and hypertrophy gains if programmed poorly. This is called the "interference effect" (Hickson, 1980). However, the practical impact is modest for most people and primarily applies to high-volume running.

### Practical Guidelines
- **Separate sessions when possible:** Lift in the morning, walk/cycle in the evening (or vice versa), or do them on different days.
- **If same session:** Lift first, then do cardio. Cardio before lifting impairs strength performance.
- **Low-impact modalities interfere less:** Walking and cycling cause less interference than running (less eccentric muscle damage).
- **Volume matters:** 2-3 sessions of 30-45 minutes of Zone 2 cardio per week will not meaningfully interfere with strength gains for most people.

## The Minimum Effective Dose

If you are primarily a strength athlete who needs some cardio for health:
- 2-3 walks of 30-45 minutes per week
- Or 2 sessions of 20-30 minutes on a bike or rower

This is enough to maintain cardiovascular health, support recovery, and keep you feeling good — without interfering with your lifting.
