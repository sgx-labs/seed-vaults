# Hip Mobility: Unlocking Your Squat and Deadlift

## The Question

Why do hips get tight, how does hip mobility affect squats and deadlifts, and what can you actually do about it?

## Why Hips Get Tight

The hip joint is a ball-and-socket capable of enormous range of motion — flexion, extension, internal rotation, external rotation, abduction, adduction. But modern life conspires against this range:

- **Prolonged sitting** keeps the hip flexors in a shortened position for hours daily. Over time, the body adapts to this shortened length.
- **Anterior pelvic tilt** (excessive arch in the lower back) often accompanies tight hip flexors and weak glutes. The pelvis tilts forward, which changes how the hip joint moves.
- **Weak or inhibited glutes** allow the hip flexors and lower back to dominate movement patterns. The glutes are the primary hip extensors — when they are not firing properly, other structures compensate.
- **Lack of variety in movement** means the hip joint only experiences a fraction of its available range on a daily basis. Range you do not use, you lose.

## How Hip Mobility Affects Lifting

### Squat
Limited hip mobility shows up as:
- Inability to reach depth (hip crease below the knee)
- Excessive forward lean (compensating for lack of hip flexion)
- Butt wink at the bottom (pelvis tucking under because the hips run out of room)
- Knee cave (lack of external rotation and abductor control)

### Deadlift
Limited hip mobility shows up as:
- Difficulty getting into the starting position with a neutral spine
- Rounding at the bottom of conventional deadlift
- Discomfort in sumo stance setup

## Key Hip Mobility Movements

### 90/90 Rotations
Sit on the floor with one leg in front (hip and knee both at 90 degrees) and one leg behind (same angles). This is a combined internal and external rotation position. Sit tall and lean gently into each hip.

- **Hold:** 30-60 seconds per side
- **Progression:** Slowly rotate from one side to the other (the "90/90 switch"), controlling the movement
- **What it trains:** Both internal and external hip rotation simultaneously
- **Frequency:** Daily, 2-3 minutes total

### Half-Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch
Kneel on one knee with the other foot forward. Tuck your pelvis (posterior tilt — think about pulling your belt buckle up toward your ribs) and gently shift your hips forward. You should feel a deep stretch in the front of the trailing hip.

- **Key detail:** The pelvis tuck is essential. Without it, you just extend through your lower back and miss the hip flexor entirely.
- **Hold:** 30-60 seconds per side
- **Add-on:** Raise the arm on the kneeling side overhead and gently lean away from the stretched hip. This adds a stretch through the lateral hip flexor and oblique.

### Deep Squat Hold (Goblet Squat as Mobility)
Hold a light weight (10-25 lbs) at your chest and sit into a deep squat. The weight acts as a counterbalance, allowing you to sit deeper with a more upright torso than you could unloaded. Use your elbows to gently push your knees out.

- **Hold:** 30-60 seconds, building to 2 minutes
- **Progression:** Shift side to side, opening one hip at a time
- **Why it works:** This is mobility training that directly transfers to the squat pattern. The deep position stretches the hip flexors, adductors, and ankle joint simultaneously.

### Pigeon Pose
From a hands-and-knees position, bring one shin forward (angle based on your flexibility) and extend the other leg straight behind you. Square your hips and fold forward over the front leg.

- **Hold:** 60-90 seconds per side
- **Modification:** If this is too intense on the knee, perform a supine (lying on your back) figure-4 stretch instead — same target area, less stress on the knee.
- **What it targets:** External rotation and glute/piriformis area of the front leg, hip flexor of the back leg.

### Hip CARs (Controlled Articular Rotations)
Stand on one leg (hold a wall for balance), lift the other knee to hip height, then slowly rotate the leg in the largest circle you can control: knee up, out to the side, behind you, and back. Then reverse.

- **Reps:** 3-5 circles in each direction per leg
- **Key principles:** Slow, controlled, and as large a range as you can manage without compensating (no twisting the torso, no shifting the standing hip). The circle does not need to be huge — quality over range.
- **Why CARs work:** They train the joint through its full available range, send a "use it or keep it" signal to the nervous system, and serve as a self-assessment tool. If one direction is significantly tighter or painful, that is diagnostic information.

## When Tightness Is Actually a Stability Problem

This is a critical concept. Sometimes what feels like "tight hips" is actually your nervous system applying muscular tension because it does not feel stable in a particular position.

Signs this may be the case:
- Your flexibility improves dramatically under anesthesia or deep relaxation
- Stretching provides temporary relief (minutes to hours) but tightness always returns
- You feel tight despite consistent stretching over weeks

The solution is not more stretching — it is building stability and motor control in the positions where you feel tight. Loaded movements through full range of motion (like deep goblet squats, split squats, and controlled lunges) often do more for "tight hips" than passive stretching because they build both the mobility and the stability your nervous system needs to feel safe in those positions.

## Programming

### Daily Maintenance (5-10 minutes)
Choose 2-3 of the above movements and cycle them throughout the week:
- Morning: 90/90 rotations + hip CARs (3 minutes)
- Evening: Deep squat hold + half-kneeling hip flexor stretch (5 minutes)

### Pre-Workout (3-5 minutes)
Before squats or deadlifts:
1. Hip CARs: 3 circles each direction per leg
2. Deep squat hold: 30-60 seconds
3. Leg swings: 10 front-to-back, 10 side-to-side per leg

### Dedicated Mobility Session (15-20 minutes)
On rest days, work through all five movements with longer holds (60-90 seconds each). Combine with thoracic and ankle mobility work for a complete session.

## Realistic Timeline

Hip mobility does not change overnight. Expect:
- **Week 1-2:** Increased awareness of restriction. Temporary improvements after sessions.
- **Week 3-6:** Noticeable improvement in squat depth and comfort if practiced consistently (4-5x per week).
- **Month 2-3:** Meaningful, lasting changes in available range of motion.
- **Ongoing:** Maintenance. The range you built needs continued use or it will regress.
