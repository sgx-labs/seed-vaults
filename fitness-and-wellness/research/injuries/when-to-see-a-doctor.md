# When to See a Doctor: A Decision Guide for Exercise-Related Issues

> **Disclaimer:** This content is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. Consult a physician before starting any exercise program. Stop any exercise that causes sharp pain. See a qualified professional for injuries or medical conditions.

> **IMPORTANT:** This note helps you decide when to seek professional care. It does NOT diagnose conditions. When in doubt, see a professional — the downside of unnecessary medical visits is far smaller than the downside of missing something serious.

## The Question

How do you know whether an exercise-related issue needs emergency care, a doctor's visit, a physical therapist, or if you can manage it yourself?

## Emergency Room: Go Now

These situations require immediate emergency medical attention. Do not wait, do not "see how it feels tomorrow."

### Chest Pain During Exercise
Any chest pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort during or immediately after exercise — especially if accompanied by shortness of breath, nausea, pain radiating to the arm or jaw, dizziness, or sweating. This could indicate a cardiac event. Call emergency services if the person is in distress.

This applies even to young, apparently healthy individuals. Cardiac events during exercise are rare but they happen, and rapid treatment is critical.

### Head Injury
Any blow to the head during exercise (dropping a weight, collision, falling) that results in:
- Loss of consciousness (even momentary)
- Confusion, disorientation, or inability to recall what happened
- Severe headache, vision changes, or repeated vomiting
- Unequal pupil size

Concussions are brain injuries. They require medical evaluation even if the person "feels fine" shortly after.

### Suspected Fracture
Signs that a bone may be broken:
- **Visible deformity** — the limb looks abnormal, bent where it should not be
- **Inability to bear weight** or use the affected limb at all
- **Severe swelling** that develops rapidly
- **A heard or felt "snap"** during the injury

Do not attempt to move or "test" a suspected fracture. Immobilize the area and get to an emergency department.

### Loss of Consciousness
Fainting during or after exercise can result from dehydration, heat exhaustion, cardiac issues, or other causes. Any loss of consciousness warrants medical evaluation to rule out dangerous underlying causes.

### Severe Bleeding or Open Wound
An injury that produces significant bleeding that does not slow with direct pressure, or an open wound that exposes bone, tendon, or deep tissue. Apply pressure and go to the ER.

### Heat Stroke
During exercise in hot conditions: core body temperature above 104 degrees F, altered mental status (confusion, aggression, loss of consciousness), hot and dry skin (or profuse sweating), rapid heart rate, nausea. This is a life-threatening emergency. Move the person to shade, cool them with water and fans, and call emergency services immediately.

## See a Doctor Soon (Within Days)

These situations are not emergencies but warrant professional evaluation rather than self-management.

### Pain That Does Not Improve With 2 Weeks of Rest and Modification
If you have reduced training stress, avoided aggravating movements, and taken appropriate rest, yet pain persists at the same level or worsens, something beyond simple muscle strain may be occurring. A physician can order imaging and refer to a specialist if needed.

### Joint Swelling
Significant swelling in a joint (knee, ankle, shoulder, elbow) that develops during or after training and does not resolve within 48-72 hours. Joint effusion (fluid in the joint) can indicate ligament damage, meniscal injury, or other structural issues.

### Numbness or Tingling
Persistent numbness, tingling, or "pins and needles" in an extremity, especially if it follows a nerve distribution pattern (down the arm, down the leg). This suggests nerve involvement — possibly a compressed nerve, herniated disc, or entrapment syndrome.

### Pain That Wakes You From Sleep
Pain that consistently wakes you from sleep or prevents falling asleep is a clinical red flag. It suggests a more significant inflammatory or structural process than simple muscle soreness. Shoulder pain at night is particularly common with rotator cuff tendinopathy.

### Clicking or Locking Joints With Pain
Painless joint clicking is extremely common and usually benign (air bubbles in synovial fluid). Clicking accompanied by pain, catching, or a sensation of the joint "locking" (unable to move through full range) suggests a mechanical issue such as a meniscal tear in the knee or a labral tear in the shoulder.

### Recurring Injuries in the Same Location
If the same body part keeps getting injured despite what you believe is good technique and reasonable programming, a professional assessment can identify underlying biomechanical issues, muscle imbalances, or structural problems that predispose you to repeated injury.

## Physical Therapist

A physical therapist (PT) specializes in movement assessment, rehabilitation, and return-to-activity programming. PTs are often the ideal first stop for musculoskeletal issues in active people — in many states and countries, you can see a PT directly without a physician referral.

### When to See a PT

- **Movement pattern issues:** Your squat always feels "off," you cannot get into certain positions, or your technique breaks down in the same way despite practice. A PT can assess mobility, stability, and motor control and provide targeted interventions.
- **Recurring strains:** The same muscle keeps getting strained. A PT can identify the root cause (weakness elsewhere in the chain, poor movement sequencing, inadequate warm-up protocol).
- **Chronic pain management:** Long-standing pain (4+ weeks) that is not resolving with rest. A PT can provide hands-on treatment, progressive loading protocols, and education about the issue.
- **Return-to-sport programming:** After a significant injury or surgery, a PT designs the graduated return-to-training plan that bridges the gap between "healed" and "ready to train at full capacity."
- **Pre-surgical assessment:** If surgery has been recommended, a second opinion from a PT is often valuable. Many conditions treated surgically also respond to rehabilitation, and a PT can help you make an informed decision.

### Finding a Good PT for Lifters
Look for:
- Sports or orthopedic specialization (ideally with strength training experience)
- An interest in getting you back to your activity, not just "resting until it stops hurting"
- Willingness to work with your training schedule and modify rather than eliminate exercise

## Self-Management: Probably Fine

These situations are common, usually benign, and typically resolve on their own with basic care.

### General Muscle Soreness (DOMS)
Delayed onset muscle soreness peaks 24-72 hours after training, particularly after new exercises, higher volume, or eccentric-heavy movements. It makes muscles feel stiff, tender, and weak.

- **Normal:** Generalized soreness in muscles you trained. Symmetrical (both legs sore, not just one).
- **Self-care:** Light movement, gentle stretching, foam rolling, adequate protein, sleep.
- **Timeline:** Resolves within 3-5 days. If it persists beyond a week, reconsider whether it is truly DOMS.

### Mild Muscle Strain
A slight "pull" feeling in a muscle during exercise that produces mild discomfort but does not prevent movement. No visible bruising or swelling. Pain improves each day.

- **Self-care:** Rest the specific muscle for 3-5 days, apply ice if swollen, gentle stretching after 48 hours, gradual return to the movement with lighter weight.
- **Timeline:** Resolves in 1-2 weeks.

### Minor Bruise or Contusion
Impact-related (dropped a weight, bumped into equipment). Skin discoloration, tenderness at the site, no significant swelling or functional limitation.

- **Self-care:** Ice in the first 24-48 hours, protect the area from further impact, continue training with modification if needed.
- **Timeline:** Resolves in 1-3 weeks.

### Exercise-Induced Headache
Mild headache during or after intense exertion, especially in heat or when dehydrated. Usually resolves with hydration, rest, and reducing intensity. If headaches are severe, sudden ("thunderclap"), or recurring with exercise, see a doctor to rule out more serious causes.

## The Decision Framework

When something hurts after training, ask these questions in order:

1. **Is it an emergency?** (Chest pain, head injury, deformity, loss of consciousness) → ER
2. **Has it persisted for more than 2 weeks despite rest?** → Doctor
3. **Is there nerve involvement (numbness, tingling)?** → Doctor
4. **Is it a joint issue with swelling, clicking, or locking?** → Doctor or PT
5. **Is it a recurring pattern?** → PT
6. **Is it general muscle soreness or a mild strain that is improving daily?** → Self-manage

**When in doubt:** See a professional. A wasted copay is better than a worsened injury.
