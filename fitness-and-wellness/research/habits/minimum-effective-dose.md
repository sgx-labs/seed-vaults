# Minimum Effective Dose: How Little Training Can Maintain (or Build) Fitness

## The Question

How little training do you need to maintain your fitness, and when is a minimum approach the right strategy?

## The Concept

The minimum effective dose (MED) is the smallest amount of training stimulus that produces a meaningful result. Below this threshold, you are not doing enough to stimulate adaptation or maintain existing fitness. Above it, you are doing more than necessary — which is fine when time and recovery allow, but wasteful when they do not.

Understanding the MED is liberating. It means that during life phases where time and energy are limited, you do not have to choose between "full training load" and "nothing." There is a middle ground that preserves most of what you have built.

## Maintenance vs. Building

This distinction is critical because the MED for maintaining fitness is dramatically lower than the MED for building new fitness.

### Building Requires More
To build new muscle and strength, you need progressive overload, sufficient volume (10-20 sets per muscle group per week), adequate frequency (2-3x per muscle per week), and a caloric surplus or at minimum maintenance-level nutrition. This typically means 3-5 training sessions per week.

### Maintaining Requires Surprisingly Little
Bickel et al. (2011) conducted one of the most cited studies on training dose for maintenance. Key findings:

- Trained individuals maintained strength for up to **32 weeks** with just **one-third** of their normal training volume
- The critical factor was **maintaining intensity** (weight on the bar) — volume could be cut dramatically
- Frequency could be reduced to **as low as 2 sessions per week** without significant strength loss
- Even **1 session per week** preserved most strength gains for extended periods in some studies

Practical translation: if you normally train 4x/week with 15 sets per muscle group, you can maintain your strength and most of your muscle with 2x/week and 5-6 sets per muscle group — as long as you keep the weight challenging.

## The Minimum for Different Goals

### Strength Maintenance
- **Frequency:** 2 sessions per week
- **Volume:** 2-3 sets per exercise (roughly one-third of building volume)
- **Intensity:** Near-normal working weights (this is the non-negotiable factor)
- **Exercise selection:** Focus on the big compounds — squat, deadlift, bench, press, row. These cover the most muscle mass in the fewest movements.

### Cardiovascular Maintenance
- **Frequency:** 2 sessions per week
- **Duration:** 20-30 minutes per session at moderate intensity
- **OR:** 1 session of 15-20 minutes of HIIT (more time-efficient but harder to recover from)

### Muscle Mass Maintenance
- **Volume:** As few as 6 sets per muscle group per week at a challenging load (Schoenfeld et al., 2017)
- **Frequency:** 2x per week per muscle group
- **Protein:** Maintain high protein intake (this becomes even more important when training volume is reduced)

## When Minimum Dose Is the Right Strategy

### New Parents
Sleep deprivation, time constraints, and the physical demands of caring for an infant make a full training program unrealistic and unwise. A minimum approach — two 30-minute sessions per week focusing on compounds, plus daily walks — maintains fitness while respecting the reality of new parenthood. This phase is temporary. Your fitness will be there when you are ready to rebuild.

### Work Crunch Periods
Major projects, deadlines, career transitions. When work demands peak, training volume should decrease. Two efficient sessions per week keep you in the game without adding to your total stress load.

### Travel
Hotel gyms are limited. Time is constrained. Bodyweight training (push-ups, bodyweight squats, lunges, pull-ups if a bar is available) plus walking maintains the habit and provides a meaningful training stimulus. A resistance band takes up zero luggage space and opens up many more exercises.

### Illness Recovery
Coming back from being sick requires a graduated approach. Start with walking and light activity. Progress to partial workouts (50% volume, 70% intensity). Build back to normal over 1-2 weeks. The MED during illness recovery is whatever your body can handle without worsening symptoms.

### Injury Modification
When one body part is injured, train everything else. Upper body injured? Focus on legs and core. Knee injury? Focus on upper body and non-weight-bearing cardio (swimming, cycling if tolerated). The minimum for the injured area may be zero; the minimum for everything else is still 2x/week.

### Mental Health Breaks
Sometimes you need to step back from structured training for psychological reasons. If training has become a source of stress, obligation, or compulsion rather than something that enriches your life, a period of minimum-dose maintenance (or even a full break) is healthy. See the training-motivation note.

## The 20-Minute Session

When time is genuinely limited, a 20-minute session can be remarkably effective:

### Example: Full Body in 20 Minutes
1. Goblet Squat: 3 x 8 (3 minutes)
2. Push-Ups: 3 x max (3 minutes)
3. Dumbbell Row: 3 x 10 each arm (4 minutes)
4. Romanian Deadlift: 3 x 10 (4 minutes)
5. Plank: 2 x 30 seconds (2 minutes)

Short rest periods (60 seconds). No warm-up fluff. Walk to the gym or do a 2-minute bodyweight warm-up and go.

### Example: Barbell Minimum in 20 Minutes
1. Squat: 3 x 5 (including warm-up ramp — 8 minutes)
2. Bench or Press: 3 x 5 (including warm-up — 7 minutes)
3. Barbell Row or Chin-Ups: 2 x 8 (5 minutes)

This covers the entire body with compound movements at meaningful loads. Done twice per week, this is a genuine maintenance program.

## Something Is Dramatically Better Than Nothing

The gap between "no training" and "minimal training" is enormous. The gap between "minimal training" and "optimal training" is much smaller by comparison.

- Zero sessions per week: Detraining begins. Muscle and strength decline measurably within 2-3 weeks.
- One session per week: Most gains are preserved. Significantly better than zero.
- Two sessions per week: Nearly all gains are preserved. The MED sweet spot.
- Three sessions per week: Strong maintenance with potential for slow progress.
- Four+ sessions per week: Building territory. Full progress.

If you can only do one session this week, do one session. It is not a failure — it is the difference between maintaining and losing.
