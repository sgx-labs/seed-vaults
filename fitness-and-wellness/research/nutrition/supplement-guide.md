# Supplement Guide: What Works, What Doesn't, and What's a Waste of Money

## The Question

Which supplements have real evidence behind them and which are just expensive marketing?

## The Supplement Industry: Context

The dietary supplement industry generates over $50 billion annually in the United States alone. The FDA does not approve supplements for efficacy before they go to market — it only intervenes after a product is shown to be unsafe. This means supplements can make vague health claims without proving they work.

This creates an environment where marketing dramatically outpaces science. Most supplements are unnecessary for people who eat a reasonably varied diet. A handful, however, have robust evidence and are genuinely useful.

## Tier 1: Strong Evidence — Worth Considering

### Creatine Monohydrate
The most researched supplement in sports nutrition history. Hundreds of studies over decades consistently demonstrate its safety and effectiveness.

**What it does:**
- Increases phosphocreatine stores in muscle, providing more immediate energy for high-intensity efforts (heavy lifts, sprints)
- Improves strength and power output (approximately 5-10% improvement in strength tasks)
- Enhances muscle recovery between sets
- Supports lean mass gains when combined with resistance training
- Emerging evidence for cognitive benefits, particularly under stress or sleep deprivation (Rae et al., 2003)

**How to take it:**
- **Daily dose:** 5g per day, every day (including non-training days). Timing does not matter — take it whenever is convenient.
- **Loading phase (optional):** 20g per day (split into 4 doses) for 5-7 days to saturate stores faster. Not required — daily 5g dosing reaches saturation in about 3-4 weeks regardless.
- **Form:** Creatine monohydrate. Not creatine HCL, buffered creatine, creatine ethyl ester, or any other marketed form. Monohydrate is the most studied, most effective, and cheapest.

**Common concerns addressed:**
- **"Does creatine cause kidney damage?"** No, in healthy individuals. The ISSN (Kreider et al., 2017) states there is no evidence of adverse effects on kidney function in healthy people, even with long-term use. If you have pre-existing kidney disease, consult your physician.
- **"Does creatine cause hair loss?"** One single study in rugby players (van der Merwe et al., 2009) showed an increase in DHT (a hormone linked to hair loss) with creatine. This has not been replicated. The connection is speculative.
- **"Does creatine cause water retention?"** Yes, slightly — creatine draws water into muscle cells. This is intracellular water (inside the muscle, not bloating) and is part of the mechanism by which it works. Expect 2-4 lbs of initial water weight gain.

**Cost:** Approximately $0.05-0.10 per day for bulk creatine monohydrate.

### Caffeine
Covered in detail in the pre-post-workout note. Summary: 3-6 mg per kg of body weight, 30-60 minutes before training. One of the most effective legal performance enhancers for both strength and endurance.

### Vitamin D
Not a performance supplement per se, but a critical nutrient that a significant portion of the population is deficient in, particularly those who:
- Live at higher latitudes (above 35th parallel)
- Spend most of their time indoors
- Have darker skin (melanin reduces vitamin D synthesis from sunlight)
- Train primarily in gyms (no sun exposure)

**Why it matters for fitness:**
- Deficiency is associated with decreased muscle function, increased injury risk, impaired immune function, and lower testosterone levels
- Supplementation to adequate levels (30-50 ng/mL blood level) supports normal hormonal and immune function

**How to take it:**
- **Get tested first.** A simple blood test (25-hydroxyvitamin D) tells you where you stand. Supplementing without knowing your levels is guessing.
- **If deficient:** 2,000-5,000 IU per day of vitamin D3 (not D2), taken with a meal containing fat (it is fat-soluble).
- **If not deficient:** No need to supplement.

## Tier 2: Moderate Evidence — Useful in Specific Contexts

### Protein Powder
Not a supplement in the traditional sense — it is food in powdered form. Whey, casein, and plant-based protein powders are convenient ways to hit daily protein targets. They offer no magical benefit over whole food protein sources.

**When it is useful:** When you are short on time, need a portable option, or find it difficult to eat enough protein from food alone. See the protein-guide note for details.

### Fish Oil (Omega-3 Fatty Acids)
EPA and DHA (the omega-3 fats in fish oil) have anti-inflammatory properties and support cardiovascular health, brain function, and joint health.

**When to supplement:**
- If you do not eat fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel) at least twice per week
- **Dose:** 1-3g of combined EPA/DHA per day (check the label — total fish oil content is different from EPA/DHA content)

**When you do not need it:**
- If you regularly eat fatty fish, you are likely getting adequate omega-3s from food.

## Tier 3: Mostly Marketing — Save Your Money

### BCAAs (Branched-Chain Amino Acids)
Leucine, isoleucine, and valine — three of the essential amino acids. Heavily marketed for muscle building and recovery.

**The problem:** If you are eating adequate protein (0.7-1.0g per pound), you are already getting more than enough BCAAs from food. Whey protein alone is approximately 25% BCAAs. Supplementing additional BCAAs on top of adequate protein intake provides no additional benefit for muscle protein synthesis (Wolfe, 2017).

**When they might help:** The only scenario is training in a completely fasted state without eating for many hours afterward. This is an unusual edge case.

### Testosterone Boosters
Products marketed as "natural testosterone boosters" (tribulus terrestris, D-aspartic acid, fenugreek, ashwagandha for testosterone specifically). The evidence is weak to nonexistent for meaningful testosterone increases in healthy individuals within the normal range.

If you suspect low testosterone, get blood work done by a physician — do not self-treat with over-the-counter supplements.

### Fat Burners
Typically a combination of caffeine, green tea extract, and various proprietary blends. Any effect on fat loss is almost entirely attributable to the caffeine content. You can get the same benefit from a cup of coffee at a fraction of the cost.

Some ingredients in fat burners have been associated with adverse cardiac events. The risk-to-benefit ratio is unfavorable.

### Most Pre-Workout Formulas
Pre-workout supplements are often caffeine in an expensive, flavored package. The effective ingredients (caffeine and sometimes citrulline or beta-alanine) are available individually for far less money. The proprietary blends often contain underdosed or ineffective ingredients.

If you want a pre-workout: a cup of coffee or a caffeine pill, plus 5g creatine. That covers the evidence-based bases for under $0.20 per serving.

### "Greens" Powders
Marketed as a replacement for eating vegetables. They are not. A powdered blend of dehydrated plant material does not provide the fiber, water content, or full nutrient profile of actual vegetables and fruits. Eat your vegetables. If you are already eating a varied diet with adequate produce, greens powders add nothing meaningful.

## The FDA Does Not Regulate Supplements for Efficacy

This is worth emphasizing. Supplements can be sold without proving they work. They only need to avoid making specific disease-treatment claims (which many get around with vague "supports" language) and not be proven unsafe.

Third-party testing (NSF Certified for Sport, Informed Sport, USP Verified) provides some quality assurance that the product contains what the label says and is free of banned substances. If you choose to supplement, look for these certifications.
