# Protein Guide: How Much, When, and From Where

> **Disclaimer:** This content is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. Consult a physician before starting any exercise program. Stop any exercise that causes sharp pain. See a qualified professional for injuries or medical conditions.

## The Question

How much protein do you actually need for muscle building and recovery, and does the source or timing matter?

## How Much Protein

The ISSN (International Society of Sports Nutrition) position stand on protein and exercise (Jager et al., 2017) provides clear guidelines:

- **General active individuals:** 0.7-1.0g per pound of bodyweight per day (1.4-2.0g per kg)
- **During caloric deficit (cutting):** Aim for the higher end (1.0g per pound) to preserve muscle mass
- **During caloric surplus (bulking):** 0.7-0.8g per pound is sufficient since ample calories support recovery
- **Sedentary adults (for reference):** The RDA of 0.36g per pound (0.8g per kg) is the minimum to prevent deficiency, not the amount for optimal performance or body composition

### Practical Examples
| Body Weight | Daily Protein Target | Per Meal (4 meals) |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 130 lbs | 91-130g | 23-33g |
| 160 lbs | 112-160g | 28-40g |
| 190 lbs | 133-190g | 33-48g |
| 220 lbs | 154-220g | 39-55g |

For people significantly overweight, use lean body mass or goal body weight rather than current body weight to calculate protein targets.

## Protein Timing

### The Post-Workout Window
The "anabolic window" — the idea that you must consume protein within 30 minutes of training or miss out on gains — has been significantly nuanced by research.

What the evidence actually shows (Schoenfeld et al., 2013):
- A post-workout meal containing protein within **a few hours** of training is beneficial
- The urgency is greater if you trained fasted (in which case, eating soon after training is genuinely important)
- If you ate a protein-containing meal 2-3 hours before training, the urgency is low — those amino acids are still circulating
- The "30-minute window" was overstated

**Practical recommendation:** Eat a meal with 20-40g protein sometime within 1-3 hours of training. Do not stress about minutes.

### Distribution Throughout the Day
Distributing protein across 3-5 meals produces better muscle protein synthesis than consuming the same total amount in 1-2 meals (Mamerow et al., 2014). Each meal should contain at least 20-40g of protein to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis.

The per-meal trigger for maximal muscle protein synthesis (MPS) is approximately 0.4-0.55g per kg of bodyweight per meal, which works out to roughly 20-40g for most people (Morton et al., 2018). Going higher is not harmful, but the MPS response plateaus after this threshold — excess protein is simply used for energy.

### Pre-Sleep Protein
A casein-based protein source (slow-digesting) before bed — such as cottage cheese or a casein shake — has been shown to improve overnight muscle protein synthesis (Snijders et al., 2015). This is not essential but is a useful tool, especially for those struggling to hit their daily protein target.

## Protein Sources

### Animal Sources
| Food | Protein per Serving | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Chicken breast (6 oz) | ~38g | Lean, versatile, inexpensive |
| Lean beef (6 oz) | ~36g | Rich in iron, zinc, B12, creatine |
| Salmon (6 oz) | ~34g | Omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D |
| Eggs (3 large) | ~18g | Complete protein, inexpensive, versatile |
| Greek yogurt (1 cup) | ~15-20g | Casein-dominant, good for snacking |
| Cottage cheese (1 cup) | ~25g | Casein-dominant, excellent pre-bed option |
| Whey protein (1 scoop) | ~25g | Fast-digesting, convenient |

### Plant Sources
| Food | Protein per Serving | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Tofu, firm (1 cup) | ~20g | Complete protein, versatile |
| Tempeh (1 cup) | ~31g | Fermented, complete protein, dense |
| Seitan (3 oz) | ~21g | Wheat gluten-based, very high protein |
| Lentils (1 cup cooked) | ~18g | Also high in fiber and iron |
| Black beans (1 cup cooked) | ~15g | Combine with grains for complete amino acid profile |
| Edamame (1 cup) | ~17g | Complete protein, snackable |
| Pea protein powder (1 scoop) | ~24g | One of the best plant-based powders |

Plant proteins tend to be less bioavailable and sometimes incomplete in amino acid profile. This is easily addressed by eating a variety of plant protein sources throughout the day — you do not need to combine them in the same meal. Vegans and vegetarians may benefit from slightly higher total protein intake (0.8-1.1g per pound) to compensate for lower bioavailability.

## Protein Supplements

### Whey Protein
The most studied and popular supplement. Fast-digesting, complete amino acid profile, high in leucine (the amino acid most critical for triggering MPS). Available as concentrate (less processed, slightly lower protein %) and isolate (more processed, higher protein %, less lactose).

**Verdict:** Convenient and effective. Not required if you can hit your protein target through food. Think of it as food in powder form, not a magic supplement.

### Casein Protein
Slow-digesting. Often used before bed to provide a sustained amino acid supply overnight. Cottage cheese and Greek yogurt are whole-food casein sources.

### Plant-Based Protein Blends
Pea, rice, hemp, and soy protein blends. Modern blends have improved dramatically in taste and amino acid profile. Pea + rice protein in combination provides a complete amino acid profile comparable to whey.

### Do You Need Protein Powder?
No. It is a convenience product. If you eat 3-4 meals per day with 25-40g protein each from whole food sources, you will hit your target without any supplementation. Protein powder is useful when:
- You are short on time
- You struggle with appetite (a shake is easier to consume than a meal)
- You need a portable option (travel, work)
- You find it difficult to hit your protein target through food alone

## High-Protein Meals and Satiety

Protein is the most satiating macronutrient. Per calorie, it keeps you fuller longer than carbohydrates or fat. This makes high-protein diets naturally helpful for appetite control during fat loss phases, even without explicit calorie counting. If you eat a protein-rich meal, you are less likely to overeat later.

## Common Concerns

### "Is high protein bad for my kidneys?"
In healthy individuals with no pre-existing kidney disease, high-protein diets (up to 1.5g per pound of bodyweight) have not been shown to cause kidney damage (Antonio et al., 2016). If you have existing kidney disease, consult your physician about appropriate protein intake.

### "Can I eat all my protein in one meal?"
Your body will use it, but distributing it across meals optimizes muscle protein synthesis. One massive meal is suboptimal compared to 3-5 smaller protein-rich meals — but it is still far better than under-eating protein entirely.
