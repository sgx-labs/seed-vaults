# Hydration for Exercise: How Much Water You Actually Need

> **Disclaimer:** This content is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. Consult a physician before starting any exercise program. Stop any exercise that causes sharp pain. See a qualified professional for injuries or medical conditions.

## The Question

How much should you drink before, during, and after exercise, and when do you need more than water?

## Why Hydration Matters for Performance

Water makes up approximately 60% of body weight and is involved in virtually every physiological process relevant to exercise: thermoregulation (cooling the body through sweat), nutrient transport, joint lubrication, blood volume, and muscle contraction.

Even modest dehydration impairs performance:
- **2% body weight loss from fluid:** Decreased endurance performance, impaired thermoregulation, increased perceived effort (Sawka et al., 2007)
- **3-4% body weight loss:** Decreased strength and power output, significantly impaired cognitive function
- **5%+ body weight loss:** Dangerous — risk of heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and serious medical emergency

For a 170 lb person, 2% is just 3.4 lbs of water — easily lost in a 60-90 minute training session in a warm environment.

## Pre-Exercise Hydration

### 2-3 Hours Before
Drink 16-20 oz (500-600 mL) of water. This gives your body time to absorb the fluid and excrete any excess before training begins.

### 20-30 Minutes Before
Drink another 8 oz (250 mL). At this point you should feel hydrated but not sloshing.

### How to Know You Are Hydrated Before Training
- **Urine color:** Pale yellow (like lemonade) indicates good hydration. Dark yellow (like apple juice) suggests dehydration. Completely clear may indicate overhydration.
- **Urine frequency:** If you have not urinated in several hours, you may be under-hydrated.
- **Thirst:** By the time you feel thirsty, you are already mildly dehydrated. Drink before thirst kicks in, especially before training.

## During Exercise

### Sessions Under 45 Minutes
Water is sufficient. Sip as needed — there is no need to force-drink on a schedule for shorter sessions. A few sips between sets or during rest periods is adequate for most strength training sessions.

### Sessions 45-75 Minutes
Drink 7-10 oz (200-300 mL) every 15-20 minutes. Water is usually sufficient unless you are a heavy sweater or training in heat.

### Sessions Over 60-90 Minutes (or in Heat)
This is where plain water alone may not be enough. You are losing sodium and other electrolytes through sweat, and high fluid intake without electrolytes can dilute blood sodium levels.

**When to add electrolytes:**
- Training sessions over 60 minutes
- Heavy sweaters (you know if you are — your clothes are soaked, you leave salt marks)
- Hot or humid environments
- Outdoor endurance activities (running, cycling, hiking)

**What to use:**
- Commercial electrolyte drinks (look for ones with sodium as the primary electrolyte, not just flavored sugar water)
- Electrolyte tablets or powder added to water
- A simple DIY solution: a pinch of salt (about 1/4 teaspoon) and a splash of fruit juice in 16 oz of water

### What About Sports Drinks?
Traditional sports drinks (like popular commercial brands) contain water, electrolytes (primarily sodium), and carbohydrates (sugar). They are designed for endurance athletes exercising at moderate-to-high intensity for 60+ minutes. For most gym-goers doing 45-75 minute strength sessions, they add unnecessary sugar and calories. Water and adequate pre/post-workout nutrition is sufficient.

## Post-Exercise Rehydration

### How Much?
The ACSM recommends drinking 16-24 oz (500-700 mL) of fluid for every pound of body weight lost during exercise. If you do not weigh yourself before and after training, a practical guideline: drink until your urine returns to pale yellow within 2-4 hours post-exercise.

### What to Drink
- Water is the primary rehydration fluid
- Include sodium with your post-workout meal (food naturally contains sodium, or add a pinch of salt)
- Milk (regular or chocolate) is actually an excellent rehydration beverage — it contains water, electrolytes, carbohydrates, and protein

### Rehydration Rate
Your body can absorb approximately 1 liter (34 oz) of fluid per hour. Drinking faster than this results in excess fluid being excreted rather than absorbed. Do not try to down a gallon immediately — spread your rehydration over 1-2 hours.

## Signs of Dehydration

Recognize these during and after training:

| Severity | Signs |
|----------|-------|
| Mild | Thirst, slightly dark urine, dry mouth |
| Moderate | Headache, fatigue, decreased performance, dizziness, reduced urine output |
| Severe | Rapid heartbeat, confusion, very dark urine or no urine, muscle cramps, nausea |

If you experience severe symptoms, stop exercising, move to a cool environment, and drink fluids with electrolytes. Seek medical attention if symptoms do not improve.

## Hyponatremia: The Other Side

Overhydration is less common than dehydration but can be dangerous. Hyponatremia occurs when blood sodium levels drop too low, usually from drinking excessive water without electrolytes during prolonged exercise.

**Risk factors:**
- Endurance events lasting 4+ hours (marathons, ultramarathons, long hikes)
- Drinking far more water than what is lost through sweat
- Small body size (lower total blood volume)
- Taking NSAIDs (ibuprofen) during exercise (impairs kidney function)

**Symptoms:** Nausea, headache, confusion, bloating, swelling of hands and feet. In severe cases: seizures, coma.

**Prevention:** Do not drink more than you sweat. Include sodium in your hydration strategy during prolonged exercise. Drink to thirst rather than forcing a rigid schedule during endurance events.

For the vast majority of gym-goers, hyponatremia is not a concern. It becomes relevant for endurance events over 3-4 hours.

## Daily Hydration Beyond Training

### General Guidelines
- **Total daily intake:** There is no universal "8 glasses a day" requirement. The Institute of Medicine suggests approximately 3.7 liters (125 oz) per day for men and 2.7 liters (91 oz) for women from all sources (food + beverages). This includes water in food, which accounts for about 20% of intake.
- **Active individuals:** Add 16-32 oz above baseline on training days
- **Hot environments:** Increase intake further

### Practical Approach
- Carry a water bottle and sip throughout the day
- Drink a glass of water with every meal
- Monitor urine color — aim for pale yellow most of the time
- Coffee and tea count toward hydration (the mild diuretic effect does not offset the water content at normal consumption levels)
