# Evidence-Based Fitness Sources

> **Disclaimer:** This content is for educational purposes only and is not medical advice. Consult a physician before starting any exercise program. Consult a qualified professional for injuries or medical conditions.

The fitness industry is flooded with misinformation, anecdote-driven advice, and influencer marketing masquerading as science. Distinguishing evidence-based information from bro-science and sales pitches is one of the most valuable skills a trainee can develop. The researchers and communicators listed below have earned credibility by publishing peer-reviewed research, transparently citing their sources, and consistently updating their positions when new evidence emerges. This is not an exhaustive list — it is a curated starting point for anyone who wants to base their training and nutrition decisions on evidence rather than hype.

## Key Researchers and Communicators

### Brad Schoenfeld, PhD
**Focus**: Hypertrophy (muscle growth), resistance training programming

Brad Schoenfeld is one of the most published researchers in the field of resistance training science. His work has shaped modern understanding of training volume, frequency, and the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy. Key contributions include demonstrating that training a muscle group 2+ times per week is superior to once per week for hypertrophy, and that a wide rep range (6-30 reps) can produce similar muscle growth when sets are taken close to failure. His textbook *Science and Development of Muscle Hypertrophy* is the definitive academic reference on the topic.

### Eric Helms, PhD
**Focus**: Natural bodybuilding, evidence-based coaching, nutrition for physique athletes

Eric Helms bridges the gap between academic research and practical application for physique athletes. He is the lead author of *The Muscle and Strength Pyramids* — a two-volume set (training and nutrition) that organizes the hierarchy of importance for training and nutrition decisions. The pyramids framework is widely regarded as one of the best conceptual tools for prioritizing what matters: adherence and calories at the base, supplements at the tip. Helms is also a competitive natural bodybuilder who practices what he researches.

### Greg Nuckols
**Focus**: Strength training, programming, research interpretation

Greg Nuckols runs Stronger by Science (strongerbyscience.com), one of the most respected evidence-based fitness resources on the internet. His strength is translating complex research into actionable training advice. He holds several national-level powerlifting records and combines practical experience with rigorous analysis. His free programs (including the 28 Free Programs spreadsheet) are among the most popular evidence-based programs available. He also co-hosts the Stronger by Science podcast, which reviews recent exercise science research weekly.

### Layne Norton, PhD
**Focus**: Nutrition, protein metabolism, natural bodybuilding

Layne Norton holds a PhD in nutritional sciences with a focus on protein metabolism and leucine signaling. His research on the leucine threshold — the minimum amount of leucine per meal needed to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis — has practical implications for meal planning. Norton is known for his advocacy of flexible dieting (IIFYM — If It Fits Your Macros) and his combative stance against nutrition pseudoscience. His content can be polarizing in tone but is consistently well-sourced.

### Andy Galpin, PhD
**Focus**: Muscle physiology, exercise performance, human performance optimization

Andy Galpin is a professor of kinesiology whose research focuses on muscle fiber type, adaptation to exercise, and human performance. He gained broader public recognition through his multi-episode series on the Huberman Lab podcast, where he covered exercise programming, recovery, and nutrition in exceptional detail. His framework for organizing training goals (strength, hypertrophy, endurance, power, speed) by their physiological requirements is one of the most accessible models for program design.

### Alan Aragon, MS
**Focus**: Nutrition research, evidence-based dietary recommendations

Alan Aragon has been a key figure in evidence-based nutrition for over two decades. He publishes *Alan Aragon's Research Review (AARR)*, a monthly publication that translates nutrition research for practitioners. Aragon was instrumental in debunking the "anabolic window" myth (co-authoring the landmark review with Schoenfeld in 2013) and has been a consistent voice for moderation, flexibility, and evidence over dogma in nutrition.

## Key Academic Publications

### Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research (JSCR)
Published by the NSCA, JSCR is one of the most cited journals in exercise science. It covers resistance training, conditioning, sports performance, and related topics. Most of the research cited in evidence-based fitness content originates here.

### Sports Medicine
A high-impact review journal that publishes systematic reviews and meta-analyses on exercise, sports science, and sports medicine topics. When you see a meta-analysis cited in fitness content, it often comes from Sports Medicine.

### International Journal of Sports Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism (IJSNEM)
Published by Human Kinetics, IJSNEM focuses specifically on the intersection of nutrition and exercise performance — topics like protein timing, supplement efficacy, and hydration strategies.

### ISSN Position Stands
The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) publishes position stands — comprehensive evidence summaries on specific nutrition topics. Key position stands cover protein and exercise, creatine supplementation, caffeine, nutrient timing, and diets for body composition. These documents are peer-reviewed, regularly updated, and freely available online. They represent the closest thing to scientific consensus on sports nutrition topics.

## Why Evidence-Based Matters

The fitness industry has a low barrier to entry for content creation and a high tolerance for unsubstantiated claims. A physique built on genetics and pharmaceuticals can be presented as proof that a particular program or supplement works. Anecdotes are elevated to the status of evidence. Correlation is routinely confused with causation.

Evidence-based fitness is not about being anti-practical or dismissing personal experience. It means:

- **Prioritizing peer-reviewed research** over anecdotes and testimonials
- **Understanding the hierarchy of evidence** — meta-analyses and systematic reviews carry more weight than single studies or case reports
- **Acknowledging uncertainty** — saying "the evidence suggests" rather than "this is definitely true"
- **Updating positions when new evidence emerges** — the willingness to change one's mind is a feature, not a weakness
- **Recognizing that research has limitations** — study populations may not match your demographics, lab conditions differ from real-world training, and statistical significance is not the same as practical significance

The sources listed above exemplify these principles. They are not infallible, and they sometimes disagree with each other — which is healthy. But they consistently show their work, cite their sources, and correct themselves when wrong.

## Practical Recommendations

- Follow 2-3 evidence-based sources rather than dozens of fitness influencers
- When you see a claim, ask: "What is the evidence for this, and who funded the study?"
- Be skeptical of anyone selling a supplement alongside their advice
- Remember that the fundamentals (progressive overload, adequate protein, sufficient sleep, consistency) account for the vast majority of results — the details these researchers debate are the remaining margin
