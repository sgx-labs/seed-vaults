# Starting Strength — Novice Barbell Training

Starting Strength is a novice barbell training program created by Mark Rippetoe, first published in 2005 and now in its third edition. It is one of the most widely recommended beginner strength programs in the fitness community and has introduced millions of people to barbell training. The program is built on a simple premise: novice trainees can add weight to the bar every single session for weeks or months, and the fastest way to get strong is to exploit this window of rapid adaptation with a small number of heavy compound barbell movements.

## The Program

### Core Lifts
Starting Strength uses five primary barbell movements:

- **Squat** (low bar back squat): Trained every session, 3 sets of 5 reps
- **Deadlift** (conventional): Trained every other session, 1 set of 5 reps (initially)
- **Bench Press**: Alternated with the press, 3 sets of 5 reps
- **Press** (overhead/standing press): Alternated with the bench, 3 sets of 5 reps
- **Power Clean**: Added after the initial phase, alternated with deadlifts, 5 sets of 3 reps

### The Novice Linear Progression (NLP)
The defining feature of Starting Strength is the novice linear progression. The trainee performs two alternating workouts, three days per week:

**Workout A**: Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift
**Workout B**: Squat, Press, Power Clean (or Deadlift variant)

After each successful session, weight is added to every lift — typically 5 lbs for squat and deadlift, 2.5 lbs for bench and press. A complete beginner might add 10 lbs per session to the squat initially. This linear progression continues for as long as the trainee can recover between sessions and continue adding weight, typically 3-6 months for most trainees.

### Why It Works for Beginners
The novice linear progression exploits a biological window that exists only for untrained individuals. When you first start lifting, your body adapts rapidly because the stimulus is novel. Neurological efficiency improves (you learn to recruit more muscle fibers), technique improves, and muscle and connective tissue begin to strengthen. This "novice effect" allows for session-to-session progress that intermediate trainees cannot sustain. Starting Strength is designed to extract maximum benefit from this window.

## Strengths

- **Simplicity**: Three exercises per session, three sessions per week. Minimal decision-making.
- **Rapid strength gains**: The NLP produces dramatic strength improvements in a short timeframe. A trainee might go from squatting 95 lbs to 225 lbs in 3-4 months.
- **Teaches fundamental movement patterns**: The squat, deadlift, bench, and press are foundational movements that transfer to virtually every other physical activity.
- **Well-documented technique instruction**: The Starting Strength book provides extremely detailed, biomechanics-based coaching cues for each lift.
- **Proven track record**: Thousands of trainees have documented their NLP results over nearly two decades.

## Common Criticisms

- **Limited upper body volume**: Only 3 sets of pressing per session, no direct arm work, no rows in the base program. Many trainees find upper body development lags behind lower body.
- **Rigid programming**: The program as prescribed does not tolerate modification well. Rippetoe and his coaching staff are firm that the program should be run as written.
- **Overemphasis on the low bar squat**: The program mandates low bar back squats, which is a valid but not universally preferred squat variation. High bar squats and front squats are dismissed.
- **Power clean learning curve**: The power clean is a technically demanding Olympic lift variant that many beginners struggle to learn without a qualified coach present.
- **GOMAD (Gallon of Milk a Day)**: The nutritional recommendation for underweight novices to drink a gallon of whole milk daily on top of regular meals is aggressive and leads to significant, often unwanted fat gain.
- **Community culture**: The Starting Strength online community has a reputation for dogmatism and dismissiveness of alternative approaches.

## Who It Is Best For

Starting Strength is an excellent choice for:

- Complete beginners who have never touched a barbell and want a structured starting point
- Trainees who value simplicity and want minimum viable programming
- People with access to a barbell, rack, and bench (the program requires standard barbell equipment)
- Those who respond well to clear, prescriptive instructions with minimal ambiguity

It may not be the best choice for:

- Trainees primarily interested in hypertrophy (muscle size) rather than pure strength
- People who want more exercise variety or upper body volume
- Trainees without access to power clean coaching (the power clean can be replaced with barbell rows, as many coaches recommend)
- Anyone who prefers a less dogmatic training community

## Context Within the Broader Landscape

Starting Strength is one approach among many valid beginner programs. Other well-regarded novice programs include:

- **GZCLP**: More upper body volume, flexible structure, tier-based programming
- **5/3/1 for Beginners (Wendler)**: Submaximal training, built-in progression, more accessory work
- **Stronglifts 5x5**: Similar structure to Starting Strength but with rows instead of cleans and 5x5 sets
- **PHUL/PHAT**: Hybrid programs for beginners interested in both strength and hypertrophy

All of these programs share the same core principles (progressive overload, compound movements, consistency) and will produce results for a novice trainee. The best program is the one that fits your goals, preferences, and equipment access, and that you will actually follow consistently.
