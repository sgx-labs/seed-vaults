# CVE Databases & Vulnerability Tracking

## Primary Databases

| Database | URL | Scope | Best For |
|----------|-----|-------|----------|
| NVD (NIST) | nvd.nist.gov | All CVEs with CVSS scores | Official severity ratings |
| GitHub Advisory | github.com/advisories | Open-source packages | Developer-friendly, integrated with Dependabot |
| Snyk Vulnerability DB | snyk.io/vuln | npm, pip, go, ruby, etc. | Detailed remediation advice |
| OSV (Open Source Vulns) | osv.dev | Open-source ecosystems | Machine-readable, Google-backed |
| MITRE CVE | cve.mitre.org | CVE assignment authority | Canonical CVE identifiers |

## How CVE Identifiers Work

Format: `CVE-YEAR-NUMBER` (e.g., CVE-2025-55182)

- **CVE** = Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
- **YEAR** = Year the CVE was assigned (not necessarily when discovered)
- **NUMBER** = Sequential identifier

## CVSS Scoring

CVSS v4.0 is the current standard for scoring vulnerability severity:

| Score | Rating | Action Required |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 9.0-10.0 | Critical | Immediate patching, possible incident response |
| 7.0-8.9 | High | Patch within days |
| 4.0-6.9 | Medium | Patch within sprint |
| 0.1-3.9 | Low | Address in normal maintenance |

## Ecosystem-Specific Databases

- **npm**: `npm audit` uses GitHub Advisory Database
- **Python**: PyPI advisory database + pip-audit uses OSV
- **Go**: vuln.go.dev (official Go vulnerability database)
- **Ruby**: ruby-advisory-db (used by bundle-audit)
- **Rust**: RustSec Advisory Database

## How to Stay Current

1. Enable Dependabot/Renovate on your repositories
2. Subscribe to security advisories for critical dependencies
3. Monitor CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) catalog
4. Run `govulncheck` / `npm audit` / `pip-audit` in CI
