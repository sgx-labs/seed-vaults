# Marketing — Distribution Channels, Directories, and Content

## Overview

Most open source projects die in obscurity, not from bad code. Marketing for OSS is not about being salesy — it is about putting your project where the people who need it will find it. You built something useful. Now make it discoverable.

## Distribution Channels (Priority Order)

### Tier 1: High-Impact, Do These First
1. **Show HN** — Technical audience, high credibility. See `research/launch/show-hn-playbook.md`.
2. **Relevant Awesome Lists** — Curated GitHub lists for your category. Persistent discovery.
3. **Reddit** — r/programming, r/opensource, language-specific subreddits. One-time spike.
4. **Dev.to / Hashnode** — Write a "how I built this" or tutorial post. Long-tail traffic.

### Tier 2: Worth Doing, Lower Effort
5. **Product Hunt** — Better for products with a UI. See `research/launch/product-hunt-playbook.md`.
6. **DevHunt** — Developer-focused alternative to Product Hunt. GitHub-verified voting.
7. **Twitter/X** — Build in public, share progress. Compounds over time.
8. **Discord communities** — Join relevant servers, be helpful, share when appropriate.

### Tier 3: Directory Listings
9. **Category-specific directories** — MCP directories, package managers, tool lists.
10. **AlternativeTo** — List as an alternative to similar tools.
11. **LibHunt** — Automated tracking from GitHub.
12. **StackShare** — Developer tool discovery.

## Content Marketing for OSS

Content that drives adoption (in order of effectiveness):
1. **Tutorials** — "How to do X with [your tool]" — solves a real problem
2. **Comparison posts** — "[Your tool] vs [alternative]" — honest, with trade-offs
3. **Build logs** — "How I built [your tool]" — attracts builders
4. **Case studies** — "How [company] uses [your tool]" — builds credibility
