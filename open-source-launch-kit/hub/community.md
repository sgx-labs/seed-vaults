# Community — Building and Managing Your OSS Community

## Overview

Building an open source community means managing contributors, handling pull requests, setting up governance, and growing engagement through Discord, GitHub Discussions, and issue triage. This hub covers every stage from solo maintainer to established project with twenty-plus contributors, including first-time contributor onboarding, code of conduct enforcement, recognition and retention strategies, and the transition from BDFL governance to a maintainer council.

## Community Building Stages

### Stage 1: Solo (0-5 contributors)
- You are the community. Your README IS your community outreach.
- Label issues as `good first issue` and `help wanted`.
- Write clear CONTRIBUTING.md (see `templates/contributing-template.md`).
- Respond to every issue and PR within 24 hours.

### Stage 2: Growing (5-20 contributors)
- Set up a communication channel (Discord/GitHub Discussions).
- Create a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and enforce it.
- Start recognizing contributors (README, releases, shout-outs).
- Document your development workflow so others can follow it.

### Stage 3: Established (20+ contributors)
- Promote trusted contributors to maintainers.
- Write governance docs (decision-making process).
- Create a ROADMAP.md so contributors know where to help.
- Consider a contributor license agreement (CLA) if needed.

## The Golden Rule

**Make people feel welcome, then make it easy for them to contribute.** Most potential contributors bounce at the first sign of friction or unfriendliness. A warm response to a first-time contributor is worth more than any amount of documentation.
