# Community — Building and Managing Your OSS Community

## Overview

Community is what separates a repo from a project. A repo with no community is just code. A project with a community is something people care about, contribute to, and advocate for. Building community is a skill — and it starts before your first external contributor shows up.

## Community Building Stages

### Stage 1: Solo (0-5 contributors)
- You are the community. Your README IS your community outreach.
- Label issues as `good first issue` and `help wanted`.
- Write clear CONTRIBUTING.md (see `templates/contributing-template.md`).
- Respond to every issue and PR within 24 hours.

### Stage 2: Growing (5-20 contributors)
- Set up a communication channel (Discord/GitHub Discussions).
- Create a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and enforce it.
- Start recognizing contributors (README, releases, shout-outs).
- Document your development workflow so others can follow it.

### Stage 3: Established (20+ contributors)
- Promote trusted contributors to maintainers.
- Write governance docs (decision-making process).
- Create a ROADMAP.md so contributors know where to help.
- Consider a contributor license agreement (CLA) if needed.

## The Golden Rule

**Make people feel welcome, then make it easy for them to contribute.** Most potential contributors bounce at the first sign of friction or unfriendliness. A warm response to a first-time contributor is worth more than any amount of documentation.
