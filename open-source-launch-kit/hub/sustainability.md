# Sustainability — Funding, Sponsorships, and Burnout Prevention

## Overview

Open source sustainability rests on three pillars: personal burnout prevention through boundary-setting and automation, financial sustainability through GitHub Sponsors, Open Collective grants, and open core business models, and community sustainability through governance, co-maintainers, and bus factor reduction. This hub covers warning signs of maintainer burnout, concrete funding options from individual sponsors to sovereign tech grants, project health metrics, security vulnerability handling, and knowing when to archive or hand off a project responsibly.

## The Three Pillars of Sustainability

### 1. Personal Sustainability (Burnout Prevention)
- Set boundaries early: response time expectations, scope of support
- Say "no" to feature requests that do not align with your vision
- Take breaks without guilt — the project will survive
- Automate everything you can (stale bots, CI, templates)
- See `research/sustainability/preventing-burnout.md`

### 2. Financial Sustainability (Funding)
- **GitHub Sponsors** — Easiest to set up, direct to your GitHub profile
- **Open Collective** — Fiscal sponsorship, transparent finances, 10% fee
- **Grants** — GitHub Fund, Sovereign Tech Fund, NLNet
- **Corporate sponsors** — Companies that depend on your project
- **Dual licensing** — Open core with paid features
- See `research/sustainability/funding-options.md`

### 3. Community Sustainability (Bus Factor)
- Document everything so others can maintain it
- Promote trusted contributors to co-maintainers
- Write a GOVERNANCE.md explaining decision-making
- Cross-train on release processes and infrastructure access
- See `research/community/governance-models.md`

## Warning Signs of Burnout

- Dreading opening GitHub notifications
- Feeling guilty about not responding fast enough
- Resentment toward users asking for help
- Working on the project out of obligation, not interest
- Physical symptoms: poor sleep, stress, anxiety
