# Sustainability — Funding, Sponsorships, and Burnout Prevention

## Overview

Most open source maintainers quit within two years. The code is the easy part — sustaining motivation, handling demands from users, and funding your time are the real challenges. This hub covers how to keep going without burning out.

## The Three Pillars of Sustainability

### 1. Personal Sustainability (Burnout Prevention)
- Set boundaries early: response time expectations, scope of support
- Say "no" to feature requests that do not align with your vision
- Take breaks without guilt — the project will survive
- Automate everything you can (stale bots, CI, templates)
- See `research/sustainability/preventing-burnout.md`

### 2. Financial Sustainability (Funding)
- **GitHub Sponsors** — Easiest to set up, direct to your GitHub profile
- **Open Collective** — Fiscal sponsorship, transparent finances, 10% fee
- **Grants** — GitHub Fund, Sovereign Tech Fund, NLNet
- **Corporate sponsors** — Companies that depend on your project
- **Dual licensing** — Open core with paid features
- See `research/sustainability/funding-options.md`

### 3. Community Sustainability (Bus Factor)
- Document everything so others can maintain it
- Promote trusted contributors to co-maintainers
- Write a GOVERNANCE.md explaining decision-making
- Cross-train on release processes and infrastructure access
- See `research/community/governance-models.md`

## Warning Signs of Burnout

- Dreading opening GitHub notifications
- Feeling guilty about not responding fast enough
- Resentment toward users asking for help
- Working on the project out of obligation, not interest
- Physical symptoms: poor sleep, stress, anxiety
