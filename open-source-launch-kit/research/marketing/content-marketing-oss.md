# How Do I Write Content That Drives OSS Adoption?

## The Question

Launch day gives you a spike. Content marketing gives you a curve. How do you write content that keeps bringing people to your project months and years later?

## Content Types (By Effectiveness)

### 1. Tutorials (Highest Impact)

"How to do X with [your tool]" — Solves a specific problem. Appears in search results when people search for the problem.

**Example:** "How to set up persistent memory for your AI coding agent"

Structure:
- Problem statement (what we are solving)
- Prerequisites
- Step-by-step instructions with code blocks
- Expected output at each step
- Complete working example

**Where to publish:** Dev.to, Hashnode, your blog, Medium (behind paywall, less ideal)

### 2. Comparison Posts

"[Your Tool] vs [Popular Alternative]" — Captures people evaluating options.

Rules for honest comparisons:
- List genuine trade-offs, not just wins
- Acknowledge where the alternative is better
- Include a "when to use which" section
- Update when the landscape changes

### 3. Build Logs

"How I Built [Your Tool]" — Attracts builders and establishes credibility.

Structure:
- The problem and why existing solutions did not work
- Technical decisions and trade-offs
- Architecture overview
- Lessons learned
- What you would do differently

### 4. Problem-First Posts

Write about the problem, not your tool. Mention your tool as ONE of the solutions.

"The state of AI agent memory in 2026" is more credible than "Why you should use our tool."

## Publishing Strategy

### Where to Post

| Platform | Audience | Best For | Longevity |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Dev.to | Developers | Tutorials, how-tos | Long (SEO) |
| Hashnode | Developers | Technical deep dives | Long (SEO) |
| Your blog | Everyone | All content | Permanent |
| Twitter/X | Broad | Updates, threads | Short |
| Reddit | Niche communities | Discussions | Medium |
| YouTube | Visual learners | Demos, tutorials | Very long |

### Posting Frequency

You do not need a content schedule. Write when you have something useful to say.

Good cadence for a solo maintainer:
- 1 post per release (what is new and why)
- 1 tutorial per quarter (solve a real problem)
- Occasional build logs (when you make interesting decisions)

## Writing Tips for Developer Audiences

1. **Lead with the problem** — not with your tool
2. **Code examples must work** — test every snippet
3. **Be honest about limitations** — credibility compounds
4. **Skip the marketing language** — developers detect and resent it
5. **Include a working example** — ideally a repo they can clone
6. **Optimize for search** — use natural keywords in titles and headers

## Measuring Impact

- **Referral traffic** — Google Analytics or simple referrer logs
- **GitHub stars from content** — Check star history against publish dates
- **Clones and downloads** — Actual adoption signal
- **Inbound links** — Other people linking to your content
