# What Directories and Platforms Should I List My Project On?

## The Question

Beyond launch-day posts, where should you list your project for ongoing discovery?

## Priority Order

### Tier 1: Do These First (Highest Impact)

**1. Relevant Awesome Lists**
Curated GitHub lists are the most durable discovery channel. They appear in search results and get bookmarked. See `research/marketing/getting-on-awesome-lists.md`.

**2. GitHub Topics and Description**
Your own repo metadata. Free, immediate, affects GitHub search.
- Add 5-10 relevant topics
- Write a clear one-line description
- Set a social preview image (1280x640px)

**3. Package Manager Listings**
If your project is installable via a package manager (npm, PyPI, crates.io, Homebrew), the registry itself is a discovery channel. Optimize:
- Keywords/tags for search
- Clear description
- Link back to your GitHub repo

### Tier 2: Worth the Effort

**4. DevHunt**
Developer-focused launch platform. GitHub-verified voting means real developers, not bots. Submit via GitHub PR to their repo. Winners get newsletter and social media exposure.

**5. AlternativeTo**
Users search for alternatives to popular tools. List your project as an alternative to relevant tools. Good long-tail traffic.

**6. Product Hunt**
Best for projects with a visual component. See `research/launch/product-hunt-playbook.md`.

**7. LibHunt**
Automated tracking from GitHub. Organizes projects by language and category. Submit via their website.

### Tier 3: Category-Specific

**8. Language-Specific Directories**
- JavaScript: bestofjs.org
- Python: awesome-python (GitHub list)
- Go: awesome-go (GitHub list, strict quality requirements)
- Rust: awesome-rust (GitHub list)

**9. Domain-Specific Directories**
- MCP tools: Glama, Smithery, mcp.so, PulseMCP
- CLI tools: command-line-tools lists
- Developer tools: StackShare, LibHunt
- Security tools: OWASP lists

**10. Content Aggregators**
- Hacker News (Show HN)
- Reddit (relevant subreddits)
- Lobste.rs (requires invite)
- Dev.to, Hashnode (write a post, not just a listing)

## Listing Checklist

For each directory, prepare:
- [ ] One-line description (under 100 characters)
- [ ] Paragraph description (2-3 sentences)
- [ ] Category/tags
- [ ] Logo or icon
- [ ] Screenshot or demo GIF
- [ ] Link to GitHub repo
- [ ] Link to documentation

## Track Your Listings

Keep a simple spreadsheet:

| Directory | Submitted | Status | URL | Traffic |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-----|---------|
| awesome-go | 2026-02-01 | Merged | github.com/... | Medium |
| DevHunt | 2026-02-05 | Listed | devhunt.org/... | Low |
