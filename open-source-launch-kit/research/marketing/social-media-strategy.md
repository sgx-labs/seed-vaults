# How Do I Build a Social Media Presence Without Being Spammy?

## The Question

You want people to know about your project, but you do not want to be "that person" who only posts self-promotional content. How do you build a genuine presence?

## The 80/20 Rule

80% of your content should be helpful, interesting, or entertaining — independent of your project. 20% can be about your project. If every post is "check out my project," people will mute you.

## Platform Strategy

### Twitter/X

Best for: build-in-public, connecting with other developers, short-form updates.

**What works:**
- Technical threads explaining an interesting problem you solved
- Behind-the-scenes of building your project (screenshots, decisions)
- Engaging with others' technical content (genuine replies, not "great post!")
- Short demos (30-second screen recordings)
- Release announcements with context (why it matters, not just version numbers)

**What does not work:**
- "Please star my repo" tweets
- Generic motivational developer content
- Posting the same link repeatedly
- Automated tweets (people can tell)

**Growth tip:** Engage with developers in your niche. Reply thoughtfully to their technical posts. Build relationships before you need anything from them.

### Reddit

Best for: reaching specific communities with targeted content.

**Subreddits to consider:**
- r/programming — General, very competitive
- r/opensource — Specifically for OSS projects
- Language-specific: r/golang, r/rust, r/node, r/python, etc.
- Domain-specific: r/selfhosted, r/devops, r/machinelearning, etc.

**Rules:**
- Read and follow each subreddit's rules (they vary significantly)
- Do not post the same thing to multiple subreddits simultaneously
- Be a member first, promoter second — contribute to discussions
- Self-promotion rules: usually 10% max of your posts should be self-promotional
- Write a useful post that happens to mention your project

### LinkedIn

Best for: reaching enterprise developers and decision-makers.

**What works:** Technical posts, project milestones, industry observations.
**Low priority** for most OSS projects unless targeting enterprise users.

### Mastodon / Bluesky

Growing developer communities. Worth having a presence, but smaller reach.

## Content Calendar (Minimal Version)

You do not need a rigid schedule. A sustainable pattern for a solo maintainer:

- **Weekly:** Engage with 5-10 relevant conversations (replies, not self-promo)
- **Per release:** Announcement thread with highlights and a demo
- **Monthly:** One longer-form post (technical thread, lesson learned, or tutorial)
- **When inspired:** Build-in-public updates, interesting problems you solved

## Measuring What Matters

Do not optimize for followers. Track:
- **Profile visits to repo clicks** — Are people finding your project?
- **Engagement on technical content** — Are developers in your niche listening?
- **Inbound from social** — Are people arriving at your repo from social media?
- **Community growth** — Discord members, GitHub stars from social referrals
