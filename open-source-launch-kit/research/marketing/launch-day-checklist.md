# Launch Day Checklist — What to Do in the First 48 Hours

## The Question

Your project is live. The Show HN post is up. What do you need to do RIGHT NOW to maximize the window of attention?

## Before Launch (T-1 Day)

- [ ] README is polished and tested on clean machine
- [ ] Install instructions verified on all supported platforms
- [ ] CI is green, tests pass, no obvious bugs
- [ ] CHANGELOG has an entry for this version
- [ ] GitHub repo has description, topics, and social preview image
- [ ] Your opening comment / maker story is drafted and ready to paste
- [ ] You have blocked 4-6 hours for active engagement
- [ ] Phone notifications on for GitHub

## Launch Hour (T+0)

- [ ] Post to your primary channel (Show HN, Product Hunt, etc.)
- [ ] Immediately post your opening comment / maker story
- [ ] Share the link on your secondary channels (Twitter/X, Discord)
- [ ] Message your soft launch group: "We are live! Would love your support."
- [ ] Start monitoring comments

## First 2 Hours (T+2)

- [ ] Respond to EVERY comment on your primary launch post
- [ ] Be helpful, not defensive — agree first, then explain
- [ ] Thank people who try your project
- [ ] Note bug reports — file GitHub issues for each one
- [ ] Watch for install/setup issues — fix them in real time if possible

## First 8 Hours (T+8)

- [ ] Continue responding to comments (check every 30 minutes)
- [ ] Post to secondary communities if the primary is going well
  - [ ] Reddit (relevant subreddit, following their rules)
  - [ ] Dev.to or Hashnode (if you have a post ready)
  - [ ] Relevant Discord servers
- [ ] Fix any critical bugs reported during launch
- [ ] Push a quick patch if install instructions were wrong

## First 24 Hours (T+24)

- [ ] Respond to any remaining comments
- [ ] Review all issues opened during the launch
- [ ] Write down the top 5 feedback themes
- [ ] Thank everyone publicly who engaged significantly
- [ ] Update README if consistent feedback pointed to confusion

## First 48 Hours (T+48)

- [ ] Write a brief retrospective (for yourself)
  - What went well?
  - What surprised you?
  - What would you do differently?
- [ ] Plan fixes for the top 3 issues discovered during launch
- [ ] Consider a fast-follow release if critical issues were found
- [ ] Submit to 2-3 directory listings while momentum is fresh
- [ ] Rest. You earned it.

## What NOT to Do on Launch Day

- Do not argue with critics (you cannot win in public)
- Do not ask for upvotes or stars (it always backfires)
- Do not launch another channel while the first is peaking (focus your energy)
- Do not try to fix major features mid-launch (ship patches, not rewrites)
- Do not disappear after posting (engagement in the first hours determines success)

## Energy Management

Launch day is exhausting. Plan for it:
- Have food and water at your desk
- Take 10-minute breaks every 2 hours
- If you have a partner or friend who can help monitor, ask them
- Accept that you will not do any other work today
- Go to bed at a reasonable time — the post will keep working overnight
