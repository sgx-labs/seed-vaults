# How Do I Handle Security Vulnerabilities Responsibly?

## The Question

Someone reports a security vulnerability in your project. What do you do? How do you set up a process before it happens?

## Step 1: Create a SECURITY.md

Add this file to your repository root BEFORE you need it:

```markdown
# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it
responsibly. **Do not open a public GitHub issue.**

Email: security@yourproject.dev

You can expect:
- Acknowledgment within 48 hours
- Status update within 1 week
- A fix or mitigation plan within 30 days

We will credit reporters in the security advisory unless
they prefer to remain anonymous.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| 1.x     | Yes       |
| 0.x     | No        |

## Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated disclosure. We will work with the
reporter to agree on a disclosure timeline, typically
90 days from the initial report.
```

## Step 2: Set Up GitHub Security Advisories

GitHub provides private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to your repo's Security tab
2. Enable "Private vulnerability reporting"
3. Users can now report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub

Benefits: No need for a separate email address. Reports stay private. You can collaborate on fixes before disclosure.

## Step 3: When a Vulnerability Is Reported

### Triage (Within 48 Hours)

1. **Acknowledge receipt** — Thank the reporter, confirm you are investigating
2. **Assess severity** — Use CVSS or a simple High/Medium/Low scale
3. **Determine scope** — Which versions are affected? Is it actively exploitable?
4. **Do NOT discuss publicly** — Keep all communication private until fix is ready

### Fix (Within 30 Days)

1. Develop the fix in a private branch or draft advisory
2. Write tests that verify the vulnerability is fixed
3. Prepare a new release with the fix
4. Draft the security advisory

### Disclose

1. Release the patched version
2. Publish the security advisory on GitHub
3. Update CHANGELOG.md with a "Security" section
4. Credit the reporter (with their permission)
5. Request a CVE if the vulnerability is significant

## Severity Assessment

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, data exposure | 24-48 hours |
| **High** | Privilege escalation, auth bypass | 1 week |
| **Medium** | Information disclosure, DoS | 2 weeks |
| **Low** | Minor issues, theoretical attacks | Next release |

## CHANGELOG Entry Format

```markdown
## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-14

### Security
- Fixed path traversal vulnerability in file import (CVE-2026-XXXX).
  Reported by @security-researcher. All users on 1.x should upgrade.
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **No SECURITY.md** — Reporters do not know how to reach you privately
2. **Ignoring reports** — Damages trust and may lead to public disclosure
3. **Public discussion** — Never discuss vulnerabilities in public issues before fix
4. **No CVE** — For significant vulnerabilities, a CVE helps users track and patch
5. **Blaming the reporter** — They are doing you a favor. Always thank them.
