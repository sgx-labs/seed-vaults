# How Do I Build a Discord Community Around My Project?

## The Question

When should you create a Discord server for your project, and how do you grow it from an empty room to an active community?

## When to Create a Discord

**Create a Discord when:**
- You are answering the same questions repeatedly in GitHub Issues
- You have 5+ active users who want real-time interaction
- GitHub Discussions feels too slow for your community

**Do NOT create a Discord when:**
- You have fewer than 5 active users (an empty server is worse than no server)
- You do not have time to be present daily
- GitHub Discussions would be sufficient

## Starting Small

Begin with the minimum viable channel structure:

```
#welcome       — Rules, links, getting started
#announcements — Releases, important updates (read-only)
#general       — Open discussion
#help          — Support questions
```

Add channels only when conversations in #general naturally split. Too many empty channels signal a dead community.

## Growth Strategies

### Passive Discovery
- Link to Discord from README, website, and GitHub repo description
- Add a Discord badge to your README
- Mention it in release notes and blog posts

### Active Community Building
- **Be present daily** — Even a few minutes of answering questions matters
- **Welcome every new member** — A personal "hey, welcome!" goes far
- **Answer questions publicly** — Others learn from the thread
- **Share project updates** — Behind-the-scenes progress builds investment
- **Ask for opinions** — "Should feature X work like A or B?" makes people feel ownership

### Content That Works
- Release announcements with context (not just "v1.2.3 released")
- "What are you building?" threads
- Show-and-tell: users sharing what they built with your tool
- Office hours: scheduled time for live Q&A

## Moderation Essentials

- Write clear rules in #welcome (be respectful, no spam, stay on topic)
- Set verification level to Medium (verified email required)
- Use slow mode (10-second delay) to prevent spam
- Assign roles: Admin, Maintainer, Contributor, Member
- Use a moderation bot for basic auto-mod (link filtering, word filtering)

## Common Mistakes

- Creating 15 channels on day one (all empty, feels dead)
- Not being present yourself (why would anyone else show up?)
- Letting Discord replace GitHub Issues (conversations get lost, unsearchable)
- No moderation plan (one toxic user drives away ten good ones)
- Not linking Discord from your README (people cannot join what they cannot find)
