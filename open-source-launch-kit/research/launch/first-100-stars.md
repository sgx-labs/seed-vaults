# How Do I Get My First 100 GitHub Stars?

## The Question

You launched. Crickets. How do you get from 0 to 100 stars — the point where organic discovery starts to kick in?

## Phase 1: The First 20 Stars (Personal Network)

The first 20 stars come from people who know you, not strangers.

- **Direct messages** — Send personal messages to 30-50 developer friends. Not "star my repo" but "I built this thing, would love your honest take." About 60% of people star when approached personally.
- **Developer group chats** — Slack workspaces, Discord servers, Telegram groups you are already a member of.
- **Colleagues and former colleagues** — People who know your work and trust your judgment.
- **Your social media** — Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Mastodon. Post once with a clear description.

Key principle: **Ask for feedback, not stars.** People who try your project and find it useful will star it naturally.

## Phase 2: 20-50 Stars (Communities)

Now you need strangers to find and try your project.

- **Show HN** — The single highest-impact post for developer tools. See `research/launch/show-hn-playbook.md`.
- **Reddit** — r/programming, r/opensource, and language-specific subreddits (r/golang, r/rust, r/node, etc.). Follow subreddit rules.
- **Dev.to / Hashnode** — Write a tutorial or "how I built this" post. Include your repo link naturally.
- **Relevant Discord servers** — Share in the appropriate channel, not as spam.

Key principle: **Be helpful first, promotional second.** Write a useful tutorial that happens to use your tool. Solve someone's problem, then mention your project.

## Phase 3: 50-100 Stars (Content and Directories)

Content creates long-tail discovery that keeps working after launch day.

- **Awesome Lists** — Find the curated list for your category and submit a PR. See `research/marketing/getting-on-awesome-lists.md`.
- **Comparison content** — Write "[Your Tool] vs [Popular Alternative]" — be honest about trade-offs.
- **Video content** — Short demo video, tutorial, or walkthrough. YouTube and Twitter/X.
- **Directory listings** — Submit to relevant directories. See `research/marketing/directory-listing-strategy.md`.

## What Actually Matters

Stars measure interest, not adoption. More meaningful metrics:
- **Clones** — People actually trying your project
- **Issues opened** — People engaged enough to report problems
- **Forks** — People considering contributions
- **Return visitors** — People coming back after trying it

A project with 50 stars and 10 active users is healthier than one with 500 stars and zero users.

## Common Mistakes

- Asking for stars explicitly (feels desperate, repels serious developers)
- Spamming the same link to many communities at once
- Launching before the project is ready to try
- Giving up after one week (traction takes months, not days)
