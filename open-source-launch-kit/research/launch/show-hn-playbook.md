# How Do I Launch on Hacker News (Show HN)?

## The Question

How do you write a Show HN post that gets traction? What do successful launches have in common?

## Why Show HN

Show HN is the highest-signal launch channel for developer tools. The audience is technical, critical, and influential. A successful Show HN post can generate hundreds of GitHub stars and establish credibility that lasts for years.

## The Formula

### Title

```
Show HN: [Name] – [what it does in plain English]
```

- Be specific and descriptive — "open-source tools for evaluating LLMs and vector DBs"
- No superlatives — avoid "fastest," "best," "revolutionary"
- No version numbers — nobody cares about v2.3.1
- Link directly to your GitHub repo, not a marketing page

### Opening Comment

Post immediately after submitting. This is your pitch. Cover:
1. **The personal story** — Why you built it, what problem you had
2. **What it does** — Concrete, specific, no jargon
3. **How it works** — Technical details (this audience wants depth)
4. **What makes it different** — Honest comparison, mention trade-offs
5. **Current limitations** — Be upfront. HN respects honesty.
6. **A specific question** — "What am I missing?" sparks discussion

### Tone

- Talk as fellow builders, not as a company selling something
- Use modest language — understatement is stronger than overselling
- Be genuinely curious about feedback
- Never be defensive in comments

## Timing

- **Best days:** Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Best time:** 8-10 AM Eastern (peak HN activity)
- **Avoid:** Weekends, US holidays, days with major tech news
- The `Show HN:` prefix puts you on the "show" tab, which is less competitive

## Engagement Strategy

- **First 2 hours are critical** — respond to every comment
- **Agree first, then explain** — "Good point. We thought about that..."
- **Thank critics** — "Fair criticism. Here is our thinking..."
- **Be technical** — Show depth. This is your audience.
- **Log all feedback** — File issues for bug reports, note feature requests

## What NOT to Do

- Do not ask friends to upvote (HN detects and penalizes this)
- Do not post from a brand-new account (build history first)
- Do not launch before your repo is ready (they WILL try to install it)
- Do not argue with critics (you cannot win, but you can lose the audience)
- Do not repost immediately if it flops (wait a few weeks, improve, try again)

## After the Launch

- Write a retrospective blog post (great content for future marketing)
- Thank people who tried your project and gave feedback
- Ship fixes for issues discovered during the launch
- Link to the HN thread from your README if it went well
