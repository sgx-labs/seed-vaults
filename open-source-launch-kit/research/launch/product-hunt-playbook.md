# How Do I Launch on Product Hunt?

## The Question

When does Product Hunt make sense for an open source project, and how do you prepare for a successful launch?

## When Product Hunt Works

Product Hunt is ideal for:
- Developer tools with a visual component (UI, dashboards, output)
- Projects with a clear "product" feel (not just a library)
- Tools that can be explained to a semi-technical audience
- Projects ready for their "1.0 moment"

It is less effective for: pure CLI tools, frameworks, or libraries with no visual story.

## Preparation Timeline

### 4+ Weeks Before

- Create your maker profile on Product Hunt
- Be active: follow products, write reviews, engage in discussions
- Maker status helps — join other launches as a co-maker if invited
- Prepare visual assets:
  - Logo: 240x240px
  - Gallery images: 1270x760px (show your product in action)
  - Video or GIF demo (60-90 seconds, optional but powerful)

### 2 Weeks Before

- Set up the product page as "upcoming"
- Share the upcoming page with your network to collect followers
- Write your tagline (60 characters max)
- Draft your maker comment (the story behind the project)
- Line up 10-20 people who will genuinely engage on launch day

### Launch Day

- Products launch at 12:01 AM Pacific Time
- Post your maker comment immediately — story, not sales pitch
- Share on Twitter/X, Discord, email list with a direct link
- Respond to every comment and question within a few hours
- Monitor throughout the day — engagement affects ranking

### Important Rules

- **Do NOT ask for upvotes** — this violates Product Hunt rules
- **Do NOT use voting rings** — Product Hunt detects and penalizes this
- Ask people to "check it out and share feedback" instead
- Authentic engagement matters more than upvote count

## Maker Comment Framework

1. The personal story — why you built this
2. The problem it solves — specific, relatable
3. What makes it different — honest comparison
4. What you are looking for — feedback, early users, contributors
5. A specific question — invites discussion

## Alternatives to Product Hunt

- **DevHunt** — developer-focused, GitHub-verified voting, less competitive
- **Uneed** — simple listing, smaller but growing audience
- **BetaList** — for pre-launch products seeking beta testers
- **Launching.io** — aggregator of launch platforms
