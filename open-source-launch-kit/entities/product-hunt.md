# Product Hunt — Launch Strategy, Timing, and Preparation

## What It Is
A community-driven platform for discovering new products. Launching on Product Hunt can generate significant initial traffic and social proof. Best for projects with a visual component or clear user-facing product.

## When Product Hunt Works Best

- Developer tools with a web UI or visual output
- Products that solve a problem non-technical users can understand
- Tools with a polished landing page and demo
- Projects ready for their "1.0 moment"

When it is less effective: Pure libraries, frameworks, or CLI-only tools with no visual story.

## Launch Preparation Timeline

### 4 Weeks Before
- Create your Product Hunt maker profile
- Follow and upvote other products (build genuine activity)
- Prepare assets: logo (240x240), gallery images (1270x760), video/GIF
- Write your tagline (60 chars max) and description

### 2 Weeks Before
- Set up the product page as "upcoming"
- Share the upcoming page to collect followers
- Prepare your first comment (the "maker comment")
- Line up supporters who will engage authentically on launch day

### Launch Day
- Launch at 12:01 AM PT (Product Hunt resets daily at midnight PT)
- Post your maker comment immediately — tell the story, not a sales pitch
- Share on your channels: Twitter/X, Discord, email list
- Respond to every comment within the first few hours
- Do NOT ask for upvotes — it violates Product Hunt rules and feels gross

### After Launch
- Thank everyone who engaged
- Write a retrospective post about your launch experience
- Keep your Product Hunt page updated with new features

## Maker Comment Template

Write authentically. Cover:
1. What you built and why (the personal story)
2. What problem it solves
3. What makes it different from alternatives
4. What you are looking for (feedback, early users, contributors)
5. A specific question to spark discussion

## Metrics That Matter

- **Upvotes** — Determine your daily ranking
- **Comments** — Signal engagement, boost visibility
- **Website clicks** — Actual traffic to your project
- **GitHub stars** — Conversion from Product Hunt to your repo
