# Show HN Post Template

Use this template to draft your Show HN submission and opening comment.

---

## Title Format

```
Show HN: [Project Name] – [what it does in plain English]
```

### Good Titles
- `Show HN: FastDB – an embedded database that fits in a single file`
- `Show HN: ShipIt – CLI tool for automating GitHub releases`
- `Show HN: Vectra – local-first vector search without a server`

### Bad Titles
- `Show HN: The world's fastest database` (superlative, unverifiable)
- `Show HN: Check out my project` (says nothing)
- `Show HN: FastDB v2.3.1 released` (version numbers are not interesting)

## Link

Always link to your GitHub repository, not a landing page. HN readers want to see the code.

## Opening Comment Template

Post this as the first comment immediately after submitting:

```
Hi HN, I built [Project Name] because [personal pain point or story].

[1-2 sentences about what it does and who it is for.]

The key idea is [core technical insight or approach].

How it works:
- [Bullet 1: architecture or approach]
- [Bullet 2: what makes it different]
- [Bullet 3: current limitations you are honest about]

It is written in [language] and is [MIT/Apache] licensed. I have been
using it for [timeframe] in [context].

I would love feedback on [specific question]. What am I missing?
```

## Comment Engagement Rules

1. **Respond to every comment** in the first 2-3 hours
2. **Agree first, then explain** — "Good point. We considered X because..."
3. **Thank critics** — "That is fair criticism. Here is how we are thinking about it..."
4. **Never be defensive** — You will not convince the critic, but you will convince everyone reading
5. **Be technical** — HN readers are engineers. Show depth.
6. **Avoid marketing language** — No "revolutionary," "game-changing," or "blazingly fast"

## Timing

- Best times: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM ET
- Avoid: Weekends, holidays, major tech news days
- The "show" tab is less competitive than the front page — you appear there automatically with the `Show HN:` prefix

## After the Post

- Monitor for 6-8 hours minimum
- Log feedback themes — they reveal real user needs
- File issues for every valid bug report
- Thank people publicly who try your project
