# Kenji Lopez-Alt — Science of Cooking

## Philosophy

Kenji Lopez-Alt is the chef and writer who turned "because the recipe says so" into "here is why, and here is the experiment that proves it." His approach to cooking is scientific in the truest sense: form a hypothesis, design a test, control variables, observe results, and report honestly — including when the conventional wisdom turns out to be right. His work at Serious Eats and in *The Food Lab* established a new standard for recipe development where every instruction comes with an explanation.

The core insight: **the best recipe is the one that explains why it works.** When you understand the mechanism, you can adapt to different ingredients, equipment, and circumstances without needing a recipe at all.

## Key Contributions

### The Food Lab

His column at Serious Eats (2010-2019) and the subsequent book *The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science* (2015) systematically tested common cooking assumptions. Each article follows a pattern: state the conventional wisdom, question it, design controlled experiments, report results with photos, and provide a recipe built on what the tests revealed. The book covers hundreds of techniques across proteins, vegetables, eggs, pasta, and more.

### Signature Techniques

- **Reverse sear** — Popularized the method of slowly bringing a thick steak to temperature in a low oven (200-275 F) before finishing with a hard sear in a ripping-hot cast iron pan. Produces edge-to-edge even doneness with a superior crust. The science: gentle heat minimizes the overcooked gray band, while a dry, hot surface maximizes Maillard browning.

- **Smash burgers** — Demonstrated that smashing a ball of ground beef onto a screaming-hot flat surface creates maximum contact area for browning, producing a thin, crispy, deeply flavorful patty. The key is smashing once, immediately, and never pressing again.

- **Dry-brining** — Showed that salting meat hours ahead (rather than wet-brining) draws moisture out, dissolves the salt, and then reabsorbs the seasoned liquid — seasoning the interior while keeping the surface dry for better browning.

- **Wok hei at home** — Developed practical techniques for approximating wok hei (the smoky, charred flavor of high-heat wok cooking) on a home stove, including small-batch stir-frying and using a cast iron skillet when a proper wok burner is not available.

### Serious Eats and Beyond

As the managing culinary director of Serious Eats, Lopez-Alt built a library of rigorously tested recipes and technique guides that became a go-to reference for home cooks. After leaving Serious Eats, he continued with YouTube videos (known for their first-person POV style filmed with a head-mounted camera), the *Wok: Recipes and Techniques* cookbook (2022), and ongoing food science writing.

## Notable Works

- *The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science* (2015) — The comprehensive technique-and-recipe book
- *The Wok: Recipes and Techniques* (2022) — Deep dive into wok cooking for home kitchens
- *Every Night Is Pizza Night* (2020) — Children's book about food exploration
- Serious Eats column archive — Hundreds of tested technique articles, still freely available online
- YouTube channel — First-person cooking videos with real-time explanation

## Applying His Approach at Home

You do not need a food science lab. Lopez-Alt's method scales down to any home kitchen:

1. **Question assumptions.** "Should I really sear meat first to lock in juices?" (No — searing creates flavor through browning, but juices are lost regardless. Sear for flavor, not moisture retention.)
2. **Test one variable at a time.** Cook two steaks identically except for one change. Compare. This is how you learn what actually matters.
3. **Use a thermometer.** Temperature is objective and repeatable. "Cook until done" is not. An instant-read thermometer is the single most useful tool for improving your cooking.
4. **Trust your results over tradition.** If your experiment shows that resting meat for 5 minutes works as well as 15, go with your data.
