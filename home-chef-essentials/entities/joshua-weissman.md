# Joshua Weissman — Leveling Up Home Cooking

## Philosophy

Joshua Weissman operates at the intersection of ambition and accessibility. His central premise is that home cooks can make food that rivals or surpasses restaurant quality — and often for less money. His "But Cheaper" and "But Better" series demonstrate that great food is not about expensive ingredients or professional equipment. It is about technique, attention, and the willingness to try making things from scratch that most people assume you have to buy.

The core insight: **making great food does not require expensive ingredients.** It requires understanding technique and being willing to put in the work. A $3 homemade burger can beat a $15 restaurant burger if you understand browning, seasoning, and bun quality.

## Key Contributions

### "But Cheaper" and "But Better"

These two video series define Weissman's approach:

- **"But Cheaper"** — Takes expensive restaurant dishes and recreates them at home for a fraction of the cost. The point is not just saving money; it is showing that the gap between home and restaurant food is mostly technique and confidence, not ingredients or equipment.

- **"But Better"** — Takes common fast food and processed items (instant ramen, fast food chicken sandwiches, frozen pizza) and makes elevated versions from scratch. Demonstrates that understanding what makes a food satisfying allows you to make a superior version at home.

Both series are effective teaching vehicles because they start with food people already know and love, then reveal the techniques and principles behind it.

### Bread Baking

Weissman is one of the most prominent advocates for home bread baking, making sourdough and other artisan breads approachable for beginners. His content covers:

- Sourdough starter creation and maintenance
- Understanding hydration, fermentation timing, and shaping
- Dutch oven baking technique for achieving professional-level crust at home
- Troubleshooting common bread failures (dense crumb, no oven spring, over-proofing)

### Fermentation

Beyond bread, Weissman explores fermentation broadly — kimchi, hot sauces, pickles, kombucha, and miso. He frames fermentation as a natural extension of cooking: once you understand the principles (salt ratios, temperature, time, and beneficial microbial cultures), you can ferment almost anything.

### Making It from Scratch

A recurring theme in Weissman's work is making pantry staples and condiments from scratch: mayonnaise, ketchup, hot sauce, pasta, tortillas, and more. The argument is not that you should always make everything from scratch — it is that making something once teaches you what it is and how to use the commercial version better.

## Notable Works

- *The Slim Palate Paleo Cookbook* (2014) — His first book, focused on his personal health transformation through cooking
- *An Unapologetic Cookbook* (2021) — A comprehensive collection spanning technique and recipes, reflecting his full cooking philosophy
- YouTube channel (5M+ subscribers) — His primary platform, with detailed cooking tutorials, series formats, and an energetic, approachable style
- *Texture* (2023) — His second major cookbook, focused on achieving restaurant-quality textures at home

## Applying His Approach at Home

Weissman's philosophy translates to practical habits:

1. **Start with what you love eating.** Pick a restaurant dish or takeout favorite and learn to make it at home. Motivation follows enjoyment.
2. **Make bread.** Even a simple no-knead loaf teaches you about fermentation, gluten, and oven heat. Sourdough is the next level, but start anywhere.
3. **Try fermenting one thing.** A jar of lacto-fermented vegetables (vegetables + salt + water + time) is the simplest entry point. It teaches you the principles that apply to all fermentation.
4. **Do the math.** Track the cost of a homemade version vs. the store-bought or restaurant version at least once. The savings are often dramatic, and the quality difference is usually obvious.
5. **Do not apologize for ambition.** Wanting to make restaurant-quality food at home is not pretentious — it is the whole point of learning to cook well.
