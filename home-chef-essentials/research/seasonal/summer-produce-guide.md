# Summer Produce Guide

## The Question

What is at its absolute best in summer, and why does summer cooking feel so different from the rest of the year? Summer produce is so flavorful that the best thing you can do is almost nothing. Peak-season ingredients cooked simply will beat a complex recipe using mediocre ingredients every time.

## The Summer Philosophy

Summer cooking is about abundance, minimal heat (both in the kitchen and on the food), and letting perfect produce shine. The grill, the cutting board, and the salad bowl are your primary tools. If you are spending an hour over a hot stove in July, something has gone wrong.

## What Is at Peak: June through August (Northern Hemisphere)

### Tomatoes

The single most dramatic seasonal difference in all of produce. A tomato in January is a mealy, flavorless object. A tomato in August, from a local farm or your garden, is one of nature's finest creations.

- **How to select:** Heavy for size, gives slightly when pressed, smells like a tomato at the stem end. Color matters less than aroma and feel — green shoulders on heirloom varieties are normal.
- **How to store:** NEVER refrigerate ripe tomatoes. Cold kills the volatile compounds that create tomato flavor. Counter at room temperature, stem-side down. Use within a few days of peak ripeness.
- **Preparations:** Sliced with olive oil, flaky salt, and basil (the Platonic ideal of summer eating). Caprese salad. Gazpacho. Panzanella (bread salad). Quick raw sauce for pasta (crushed ripe tomatoes + garlic + olive oil + basil, tossed with hot pasta). BLT sandwiches with the best bread you can find.

The superiority of peak-season tomatoes cannot be overstated. Plan meals around them while they last.

### Corn

Fresh sweet corn at peak season is so sweet it can be eaten raw. It loses sweetness rapidly after harvest as sugar converts to starch.

- **How to select:** Bright green, tight husks. Silk should be brown and slightly sticky (not dried out). Peel back a small section to check — kernels should be plump and release milky juice when pressed.
- **How to store:** Eat as soon as possible. Refrigerate with husks on up to 2 days.
- **Preparations:** Grilled in the husk (15-20 minutes, turning occasionally). Boiled 3-5 minutes (no more). Cut off the cob for salads, salsas, and succotash. Corn stock from the cobs (simmer stripped cobs in water for 30 minutes — sweet, useful broth for chowder or risotto).

### Stone Fruit (Peaches, Plums, Nectarines, Cherries, Apricots)

Stone fruit at peak is soft, fragrant, and dripping with juice. Off-season stone fruit is a disappointment.

- **How to select:** Fragrant at room temperature. Gives slightly to gentle pressure. Should smell like what it is. Avoid hard, unripe fruit (stone fruit ripens in flavor but not sweetness after picking).
- **How to store:** Counter until ripe, then refrigerate up to 3-4 days.
- **Preparations:** Eat out of hand (always the first choice). Grilled peach halves with ice cream. Sliced over yogurt or ricotta with honey. Peach cobbler or crisp. Stone fruit salsa (diced with jalapeno, lime, cilantro). Cherries: eat fresh, or pit and bake into clafoutis.

### Zucchini and Summer Squash

Abundant to the point of comedy — every gardener has too much zucchini by July.

- **How to select:** Small to medium (6-8 inches). Skin should be glossy and free of soft spots. Large zucchini are watery and seedy.
- **How to store:** Refrigerate in a bag up to 1 week.
- **Preparations:** Grilled in thick planks. Sauteed with garlic and lemon. Shaved raw into ribbons for salads. Zucchini fritters. Spiralized as "noodles." Baked into bread or muffins (the classic surplus solution).

### Peppers (Sweet and Hot)

Both bell peppers and hot peppers reach their sweetest, most complex flavor in mid-summer.

- **How to select:** Firm, glossy, heavy for size. Bell peppers: any color (green is less ripe and slightly bitter; red, yellow, orange are fully ripe and sweeter).
- **How to store:** Refrigerate up to 2 weeks (one of the longer-lasting summer vegetables).
- **Preparations:** Raw in salads and as dippers. Roasted (char under the broiler, steam in a covered bowl, peel). Stuffed and baked. Stir-fried. Hot peppers: salsa, hot sauce, infused oils.

### Eggplant

At its best in high summer. Properly cooked eggplant is creamy, rich, and meaty.

- **How to select:** Heavy for size, taut glossy skin, firm flesh. Press with a thumb — it should spring back. Brown seeds inside indicate age.
- **How to store:** Refrigerate up to 5 days (eggplant is sensitive to cold — use quickly).
- **Preparations:** Roast whole until collapsed, then scoop and make baba ganoush. Slice thick, brush with oil, grill until charred and creamy. Cube and fry for stir-fries or curries. Salt slices and let sit 30 minutes to draw out bitterness (more relevant for older, seedy eggplant than fresh peak-season).

### Berries (Blueberries, Blackberries, Raspberries)

Summer berries are a luxury when local and in season — fragile, perishable, and worth every cent.

- **How to select:** Dry, plump, deeply colored. Avoid containers with staining on the bottom (crushed, leaking berries).
- **How to store:** Do not wash until ready to use. Spread on a paper towel-lined plate in the fridge. Use within 2-3 days.
- **Preparations:** Eat fresh. Over yogurt, oatmeal, or ice cream. In pies, cobblers, and crisps. Macerated with sugar for topping. Blended into smoothies. Frozen at peak for winter use (spread on a sheet pan, freeze, then transfer to bags).

### Melons (Watermelon, Cantaloupe, Honeydew)

Peak melon in summer is sweet, juicy, and perfumed.

- **How to select:** Watermelon: heavy for size, yellow ground spot (where it sat on the ground), hollow sound when tapped. Cantaloupe: fragrant at the stem end, slight give when pressed. Honeydew: waxy (not fuzzy) skin, gives slightly.
- **How to store:** Whole at room temperature until cut, then refrigerate.
- **Preparations:** Eat cold, sliced. Watermelon with feta, mint, and lime. Cantaloupe wrapped in prosciutto. Melon agua fresca. Granita (freeze pureed melon, scrape with a fork).

### Green Beans

Crisp, sweet, and versatile. Fresh summer green beans are a different vegetable from the canned version.

- **How to select:** Snap crisply when bent. Avoid limp or bulging pods.
- **How to store:** Refrigerate in a bag up to 1 week.
- **Preparations:** Blanch and shock (bright green, crisp-tender). Saute with garlic. Roast at 425F until blistered. Raw in salads (very fresh beans only). The classic nicoise salad.

### Fresh Herbs

Basil, cilantro, mint, dill, and parsley are at their most abundant and cheapest in summer.

- **How to store:** Basil: room temperature in a glass of water (never refrigerate — it turns black). Others: stems in water in the fridge, covered with a loose bag.
- **Use generously.** Summer is the time to use herbs by the handful, not the pinch.

## Summer Cooking Principles

1. **Cook less, assemble more.** Salads, raw preparations, quick grills.
2. **Use the grill.** Keep heat outside the kitchen.
3. **Shop twice a week.** Peak summer produce is perishable — buy smaller amounts more often.
4. **Preserve the surplus.** Freeze berries, make tomato sauce for winter, dry herbs. Summer's bounty can extend into the cold months.
5. **Drink your produce.** Gazpacho, agua fresca, smoothies, herb-infused water.
