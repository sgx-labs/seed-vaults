# Spring Produce Guide

## The Question

What is at its absolute best in spring, how do you choose it, and how do you cook it so it tastes like the season? Spring produce is about freshness, brightness, and minimal intervention — let the ingredients do the talking after months of hearty winter food.

## The Spring Philosophy

After a winter of root vegetables, braises, and stored produce, spring is a reset. The produce is tender, delicate, and at its best with light cooking or none at all. The guiding principle: do less. A perfect spring vegetable needs olive oil, salt, maybe lemon, and nothing else.

## What Is at Peak: March through May (Northern Hemisphere)

### Asparagus

The herald of spring. At its peak, asparagus is sweet, grassy, and needs almost no cooking.

- **How to select:** Firm, taut stalks with tightly closed tips. Avoid limp, wrinkled, or slimy spears. Thickness is preference, not quality — thin and thick are equally good, just different.
- **How to store:** Stand upright in a glass with an inch of water, covered with a loose bag. Use within 3-4 days.
- **Preparations:** Snap off the woody ends (they break naturally at the right spot). Roast at 425F with olive oil and salt (8-10 minutes). Grill over high heat (3-4 minutes). Shave raw with a peeler into salads. Blanch and serve with hollandaise.

### Peas (English, Sugar Snap, Snow)

Fresh peas at peak season are nothing like the frozen version — sweeter, more complex, and worth eating straight from the pod.

- **How to select:** Bright green, firm pods. English peas: pods should feel full but not bulging. Sugar snaps: should snap crisply when bent.
- **How to store:** Refrigerate immediately. Sugar converts to starch quickly — use within 2-3 days for best sweetness.
- **Preparations:** English peas: shell and eat raw, or blanch 1-2 minutes. Sugar snaps: eat raw, stir-fry, or blanch briefly. Snow peas: stir-fry or eat raw in salads. Pea shoots make a beautiful, delicate salad green.

### Artichokes

Intimidating to prep but worth the effort. The tender heart and leaves, dipped in butter or vinaigrette, are one of spring's great pleasures.

- **How to select:** Heavy for size, tightly closed leaves, squeaks when squeezed. Brown spots from frost are cosmetic, not quality issues.
- **How to store:** Refrigerate in a plastic bag up to 1 week.
- **Preparations:** Whole steamed (30-40 minutes, pull off leaves and scrape the flesh with your teeth). Trimmed hearts braised in olive oil and lemon. Baby artichokes halved and roasted or fried.

### Strawberries

Local, in-season strawberries bear no resemblance to the pale, hollow supermarket version. They are deeply red all the way through, fragrant, and intensely sweet.

- **How to select:** Deep red color, fragrant at room temperature, green caps still attached. Avoid white shoulders or soft spots.
- **How to store:** Do not wash until ready to use. Spread on a paper towel-lined plate in the fridge. Use within 2-3 days.
- **Preparations:** Eat raw (always the first choice when they are perfect). Macerate with a little sugar and lemon for shortcakes. Roast at 375F until jammy. Quick compote over yogurt or ice cream.

### Rhubarb

Technically a vegetable, used as a fruit. Extremely tart on its own — it needs sweetness to balance.

- **How to select:** Firm, crisp stalks. Color varies from green to deep red (both taste the same). Avoid limp or soft stalks.
- **How to store:** Refrigerate in a plastic bag up to 2 weeks. Freezes well for later use.
- **Preparations:** Stewed with sugar for compote (cut into 1-inch pieces, add sugar to taste, simmer 10 minutes). Strawberry-rhubarb pie or crisp (the classic pairing). Rhubarb syrup for cocktails.

### Radishes

Peppery, crunchy, and beautiful. Radishes are at their mildest and sweetest in spring.

- **How to select:** Firm, smooth skin, bright green tops (if attached). Avoid spongy or cracked radishes.
- **How to store:** Remove the greens (they draw moisture from the root). Store roots in a bag in the crisper. Greens can be sauteed like any cooking green.
- **Preparations:** Eat raw with butter and flaky salt (the classic French snack). Roast at 400F until tender and sweet (roasting mellows the bite). Slice thin for salads. Quick-brined for tacos and bowls.

### Spring Onions and Scallions

The first alliums of the season — milder and sweeter than storage onions.

- **How to select:** Firm white bulbs, fresh green tops, no slime.
- **How to store:** Refrigerate in a bag up to 1 week.
- **Preparations:** Grill whole until charred and sweet. Slice raw for garnish. Saute the white parts as you would regular onion; use the greens raw as an herb.

### Fava Beans

A labor of love (double-shelling: remove from pod, then blanch and remove the outer skin of each bean) but the resulting bright green, buttery bean is exquisite.

- **How to select:** Plump, green pods without black spots.
- **How to store:** Refrigerate up to 1 week. Shell just before using.
- **Preparations:** Blanch, peel, toss with olive oil, lemon, and pecorino. Mash onto toast with ricotta. Add to pasta with mint.

### Morel Mushrooms

One of the great culinary prizes of spring. Earthy, nutty, meaty flavor found nowhere else.

- **How to select:** Dry, not slimy. Uniform brown color. Available at farmers markets and specialty stores.
- **How to store:** Paper bag in the refrigerator. Use within 2-3 days.
- **Preparations:** Saute in butter (the classic preparation — nothing more needed). Add to risotto. Stuff with cheese and herbs. Always cook morels — they should not be eaten raw.

### New Potatoes

Small, thin-skinned potatoes freshly dug. The skin is so tender it does not need peeling.

- **How to select:** Small, firm, smooth skin.
- **How to store:** Cool, dark place. Use within 1-2 weeks (they do not store as long as mature potatoes).
- **Preparations:** Boil until tender, toss with butter and fresh herbs (dill, chives, parsley). Roast halved at 425F. Smash and crisp in a hot pan. Potato salad with a mustardy vinaigrette.

## Spring Cooking Principles

1. **Cook less.** Many spring vegetables are best raw or barely cooked.
2. **Use gentle heat.** Quick blanching, light sauteing, brief roasting.
3. **Acid forward.** Lemon juice, light vinegars, and fresh herbs match spring produce beautifully.
4. **Finish with good olive oil and flaky salt.** Simple preparations demand quality finishing ingredients.
5. **Celebrate the ephemeral.** Morels, ramps, fava beans, and perfect strawberries last only weeks. Eat them now — they will not be back for a year.
