# Year-Round Staples

## The Question

What produce and pantry items are available regardless of season, and when is the frozen or canned version actually as good as (or better than) fresh? Building meals around reliable year-round staples means you always have the foundation for a good meal.

## Year-Round Fresh Produce

These items are available nearly everywhere, nearly all year, due to global sourcing, long storage life, or year-round growing conditions.

### Onions

The foundation of nearly every savory dish across every cuisine.

- **Yellow onions:** All-purpose, slightly sweet when cooked, the default cooking onion.
- **Red onions:** Milder raw, beautiful in salads and quick-brined preparations.
- **White onions:** Sharper, traditional in Mexican cooking.
- **How to store:** Cool, dark, dry place (not the refrigerator) for 1-2 months. Keep away from potatoes (they accelerate each other's spoilage through ethylene gas).
- **Always have them.** An onion, garlic, and a can of tomatoes is the start of a hundred meals.

### Garlic

Indispensable. Fresh garlic is available year-round and keeps for weeks.

- **How to select:** Firm, heavy heads with tight papery skin. No green sprouts (these indicate age and can taste bitter, though still usable).
- **How to store:** Cool, dark, dry place with airflow. Not in a sealed container. Lasts 3-4 weeks whole; less once broken into cloves.
- **Usage note:** Pre-minced garlic in jars is convenient but has a different (often harsher) flavor than fresh. Fresh garlic is worth the 30 seconds of mincing.

### Potatoes

One of the most versatile, inexpensive, and satisfying staple foods in existence.

- **Russet:** High starch, fluffy. Best for baking, mashing, frying.
- **Yukon Gold:** Medium starch, buttery. Best for roasting, mashing, general purpose.
- **Red/fingerling:** Low starch, waxy. Best for boiling, potato salads, roasting (holds shape).
- **How to store:** Cool, dark, dry place. Not in the refrigerator (cold converts starch to sugar, affecting texture and browning). Away from onions.
- **Keep potatoes on hand** and you always have a meal: baked potato with toppings, roasted potatoes, mashed potatoes, potato soup, home fries.

### Carrots

Available year-round, inexpensive, and remarkably versatile.

- **How to store:** Refrigerate in a bag up to 3-4 weeks. Cut off green tops (they draw moisture from the root).
- **Preparations:** Raw for snacking and salads. Roasted (caramelizes their natural sugars beautifully). In soups and stews. Mirepoix base (onion + carrot + celery). Shredded into slaws. Carrot soup with ginger.

### Celery

The third member of the mirepoix trinity. Steady, reliable, always available.

- **How to store:** Refrigerate wrapped in foil (the ethylene it produces escapes through foil but not plastic, keeping it crisp longer). Lasts 2-3 weeks.
- **Preparations:** Raw with hummus or dips. In soups, stews, and braises. In salads (the inner pale hearts are the most tender). The leaves are an herb — use them as you would parsley.

### Bananas

The world's most popular fruit. Available everywhere, all year.

- **How to store:** Counter at room temperature. Separate from other fruit (they produce significant ethylene). Overripe bananas: freeze for smoothies or banana bread.
- **Preparations:** Eat fresh. Smoothies. Banana bread (the perfect vehicle for overripe bananas). Sliced over oatmeal or yogurt. Caramelized in butter and brown sugar for a quick dessert.

### Lemons

Essential for the home kitchen. A squeeze of lemon brightens almost any dish.

- **How to store:** Counter for a week, refrigerator for 3-4 weeks.
- **Always have lemons.** They finish salad dressings, brighten soups, deglaze pans, add acid to flat dishes, zest into baked goods, and make plain water more appealing.

### Ginger

Fresh ginger root is available year-round in most grocery stores.

- **How to store:** Refrigerate unpeeled up to 3 weeks. Freeze whole for months (grate directly from frozen — it grates more easily frozen than fresh).
- **Preparations:** Mince for stir-fries and curries. Grate into dressings and marinades. Slice for tea. Essential in Asian, Indian, and many other cuisines.

### Avocados

Seasonal in origin but available year-round through global sourcing. Supply fluctuates (as does price).

- **How to select:** Give slightly to gentle pressure. Firm avocados ripen on the counter in 2-4 days. Speed up ripening in a paper bag with a banana.
- **How to store:** Counter until ripe, then refrigerate up to 3 days.
- **Preparations:** Toast with salt, lemon, and red pepper flakes. Guacamole. Sliced on everything — bowls, tacos, sandwiches, soups. Blended into dressings for creaminess.

## Why Frozen Vegetables Are Great

Here is a truth that contradicts much of what the food world implies: **frozen vegetables are nutritionally comparable to fresh — and often better.**

The science is clear. Commercially frozen vegetables are:
1. **Harvested at peak ripeness** (maximum nutrient content).
2. **Blanched** (brief hot water treatment that stops enzyme activity that degrades nutrients).
3. **Flash-frozen within hours** of harvest, locking in nutrients.

Meanwhile, "fresh" vegetables at the supermarket were often:
1. Harvested before peak ripeness (to survive shipping).
2. Transported for days or weeks (nutrients degrade during transit and storage).
3. Sitting on the shelf for additional days.

Studies consistently show that frozen vegetables retain vitamins C, A, and folate as well as or better than fresh vegetables that have been stored for several days. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health confirms this.

### Best Frozen Vegetables to Keep on Hand

| Vegetable | Why It's Good Frozen | Use For |
|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| Peas | Flash-frozen at peak sweetness | Stir-fries, soups, pasta, rice dishes |
| Corn | Holds sweetness well | Soups, stir-fries, salsa, grain bowls |
| Spinach | Convenient, nutrient-dense | Soups, smoothies, pasta, egg dishes |
| Broccoli | Decent texture when cooked from frozen | Stir-fries, casseroles, soups |
| Green beans | Good for cooking (not raw eating) | Stir-fries, casseroles, steamed sides |
| Mixed stir-fry blend | Convenient weeknight shortcut | Quick stir-fries over rice |
| Edamame | Perfect from frozen | Snacking, grain bowls, stir-fries |

**Do not thaw most frozen vegetables before cooking.** Cook directly from frozen in a hot pan or boiling water. Thawing creates a soggy mess because the ice crystals rupture cell walls.

**The exception:** Frozen spinach should be thawed and squeezed dry before adding to dishes (too much water otherwise).

## Canned Pantry Staples

These should always be in your pantry:

| Item | Why | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Whole peeled tomatoes | Base for sauces, soups, braises | San Marzano or quality brand. Crush by hand for rustic texture |
| Crushed tomatoes | Faster sauce base | Good when you want a smoother texture |
| Beans (black, cannellini, chickpeas) | Protein, fiber, versatility | Rinse canned beans to reduce sodium by ~40% |
| Coconut milk (full fat) | Curries, soups, desserts | Full fat only — light versions are watery |
| Tuna/sardines | Quick protein | Packed in olive oil for best flavor |
| Chicken/vegetable stock | Sauce base, cooking liquid | Low-sodium so you control the salt |

## The Year-Round Pantry Mindset

Seasonal cooking is wonderful and worth pursuing. But the backbone of everyday home cooking is a stocked pantry of staples — fresh alliums, potatoes, lemons, frozen vegetables, and canned goods — that are available regardless of the calendar. Master these staples and you can always make dinner, even when you have not been to the market in days.
