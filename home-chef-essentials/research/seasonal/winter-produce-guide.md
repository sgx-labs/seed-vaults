# Winter Produce Guide

## The Question

What is actually in season during the coldest months, and how do you eat well when the farmers market shrinks to a few hardy vendors? Winter cooking is about hearty preparations, stored and preserved foods, and the glorious arrival of citrus season.

## The Winter Philosophy

Winter is long-cooked food season. Braises, stews, soups, roasted root vegetables, and warming grains. The produce is hardier — cabbages, kale, roots — built to store and designed for transformation through heat. But winter also brings one of the year's great gifts: citrus at peak. Lemons, oranges, grapefruits, and mandarins bring brightness to heavy dishes.

And here is winter's secret weapon: **canned tomatoes.** Fresh tomatoes in winter are flavorless imposters. Quality canned tomatoes (San Marzano or any good brand) were processed at peak summer ripeness. They are better than any fresh tomato available from December through May.

## What Is at Peak: December through February (Northern Hemisphere)

### Citrus (All Types)

Winter's most important produce category. Citrus brightens everything — braises, roasted vegetables, salads, desserts, cocktails.

**Oranges (navel, blood, cara cara):**
- **How to select:** Heavy for size (more juice), firm, fragrant.
- **Preparations:** Eat fresh (navel for eating, Valencia for juicing). Blood orange segments in salads with fennel and olive oil. Cara cara (pink-fleshed, sweeter) in fruit salads. Zest into everything — baked goods, dressings, marinades.

**Grapefruits:**
- **How to select:** Heavy, smooth skin, gives slightly.
- **Preparations:** Halved and broiled with brown sugar. Segmented in salads with avocado and shrimp. Fresh-squeezed juice.

**Lemons and Meyer lemons:**
- Meyer lemons (sweeter, more floral than standard lemons) are a winter specialty.
- **Preparations:** Squeeze onto everything — braises, roasted vegetables, soups. Meyer lemon curd. Preserved lemons (salt-cured, essential in North African cooking).

**Mandarins, clementines, tangerines:**
- The snacking citrus. Easy to peel, sweet, portable.
- **Preparations:** Eat out of hand. Segments in salads. Juice for vinaigrettes.

### Kale

The quintessential winter green. Hardy, nutritious, and improved by cold weather (frost converts starches to sugars).

- **How to select:** Deep color (dark green, purple, or blue-green depending on variety). Avoid yellowed or wilted leaves.
- **How to store:** Refrigerate in a bag up to 1 week. Heartier than most greens.
- **Preparations:** Massaged raw salad (rub torn leaves with olive oil and salt for 2-3 minutes — this breaks down the tough cell walls and makes it tender). Sauteed with garlic and red pepper flakes. Braised slowly until silky. In soups (add in the last 10-15 minutes). Kale chips (toss with oil and salt, bake at 300F until crispy).

### Cabbage (Green, Red, Savoy, Napa)

Incredibly versatile, inexpensive, and stores for weeks. Cabbage is the unsung hero of winter cooking.

- **How to select:** Heavy, tight heads. Avoid cracked or dried-out outer leaves.
- **How to store:** Refrigerate whole up to 2 months (seriously — cabbage is the champion of fridge longevity).
- **Preparations:** Shredded for coleslaw. Braised with apple and caraway (a German classic). Roasted in wedges at 425F until charred. Stir-fried (napa cabbage in Asian dishes). Fermented into sauerkraut. In soups and stews. Stuffed cabbage rolls.

### Leeks

The elegant allium. Milder and sweeter than onions, with a silky texture when cooked.

- **How to select:** White and light green parts should be firm. Dark green tops are tougher but excellent in stock.
- **How to store:** Refrigerate up to 2 weeks.
- **Critical prep:** Slice lengthwise and rinse thoroughly — leeks trap sand between their layers.
- **Preparations:** Potato-leek soup (vichyssoise when served cold). Braised in butter until meltingly soft. In quiche and tarts. Grilled whole and served with vinaigrette.

### Turnips and Rutabagas

Underappreciated root vegetables that are sweet, peppery, and excellent roasted.

- **How to select:** Firm, heavy, smooth skin. Smaller turnips are milder.
- **How to store:** Refrigerate up to 3 weeks.
- **Preparations:** Roasted at 425F until caramelized (turnips become surprisingly sweet). Mashed (alone or mixed with potatoes for lighter mash). In stews and braises. Raw young turnips: slice thin for salads (peppery, fresh).

### Parsnips

Carrots' sweeter, more complex cousin. Parsnips become remarkably sweet after frost.

- **How to select:** Firm, pale cream color, no floppiness.
- **How to store:** Refrigerate up to 3 weeks.
- **Preparations:** Roast at 425F (they caramelize beautifully). Puree into soup with apple and curry. Mash with butter and nutmeg. Add to root vegetable medleys. Parsnip fries (cut into batons, roast at high heat).

### Celery Root (Celeriac)

Ugly on the outside, delicious on the inside. Tastes like celery crossed with potato — earthy, nutty, subtle.

- **How to select:** Heavy, firm, no soft spots. Size does not affect quality.
- **How to store:** Refrigerate up to 3 weeks.
- **Preparations:** Celery root remoulade (raw, julienned, tossed with a mustardy, creamy dressing — a French bistro classic). Pureed into soup. Roasted in cubes. Mashed (alone or mixed with potato for a more complex mash).

### Endive, Radicchio, and Chicories

Bitter greens that thrive in cold weather. Their bitterness is a feature, not a bug — it provides contrast and complexity.

- **How to select:** Compact, firm heads. Endive should be pale (light deprivation during growing keeps it mild).
- **How to store:** Refrigerate up to 2 weeks.
- **Preparations:** Raw in salads with sweet elements (pear, citrus, nuts, cheese) to balance bitterness. Grilled or braised radicchio (heat mellows the bitterness and brings out sweetness). Endive boats as appetizer vessels (fill with herbed goat cheese, or blue cheese and walnuts).

### Persimmons

Two types: Fuyu (squat, eaten firm like an apple) and Hachiya (elongated, must be fully soft/ripe or they are astringently inedible).

- **How to select:** Fuyu: firm and glossy. Hachiya: completely soft (like a water balloon) when ripe.
- **How to store:** Ripen at room temperature. Refrigerate when ripe.
- **Preparations:** Fuyu: slice into salads with arugula, pomegranate, and goat cheese. Hachiya: puree into persimmon pudding, baked goods, or eat with a spoon.

### Stored Root Vegetables

Carrots, potatoes, beets, and onions from fall harvests are available throughout winter from storage.

- These are the backbone of winter soups, roasts, and braises.
- Root vegetable roasts (cut a mix of roots into similar sizes, toss with oil and herbs, roast at 425F) are one of winter's simplest and most satisfying dishes.

## Why Canned Tomatoes Are Your Winter Friend

Fresh tomatoes available from November through May (in most of the Northern Hemisphere) were picked unripe, shipped long distances, and gas-ripened. They taste like wet cardboard compared to a summer tomato.

Quality canned tomatoes — San Marzano, or any brand using tomatoes processed at peak ripeness — deliver actual tomato flavor year-round. Stock your pantry with whole peeled canned tomatoes and crushed tomatoes. They are the base of winter pasta sauces, braised dishes, soups, and stews.

## Winter Cooking Principles

1. **Braise and simmer.** The long, slow cooking of winter matches the hearty produce.
2. **Use citrus for brightness.** A squeeze of lemon or orange zest lifts heavy winter dishes.
3. **Embrace the pantry.** Dried beans, canned tomatoes, spices, and grains anchor winter cooking.
4. **Root vegetables are your canvas.** Roast, mash, braise, or puree them.
5. **Make stock.** Cold weather and simmering stock go together. The warmth and aroma improve any kitchen.
