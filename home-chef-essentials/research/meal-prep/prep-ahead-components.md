# Prep-Ahead Components

## The Question

What are the high-impact components you can prepare in advance that transform weeknight cooking from a chore into a 10-minute assembly? The right components in the fridge turn an ordinary meal into something that tastes like you spent an hour cooking.

## Herb Sauces — The Biggest Upgrade

A spoonful of a bright, punchy herb sauce on anything — grilled chicken, roasted vegetables, a grain bowl, scrambled eggs — elevates it from "fine" to "restaurant-quality." These take 10 minutes to make and keep for days.

### Chimichurri
- Parsley, oregano, garlic, red wine vinegar, olive oil, red pepper flakes, salt.
- Chop herbs fine, mix everything, let sit 30 minutes for flavors to meld.
- **Keeps:** 1 week refrigerated. Flavors deepen over the first 24 hours.
- **Use on:** Grilled steak, roasted vegetables, grain bowls, eggs, bread.

### Pesto
- Basil (classic), pine nuts (or walnuts, or sunflower seeds for budget), parmesan, garlic, olive oil, salt.
- Blend or pulse in food processor. Taste and adjust salt and lemon juice.
- **Keeps:** 1 week refrigerated (press plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent browning). Freezes beautifully in ice cube trays for months.
- **Use on:** Pasta, sandwiches, pizza, grain bowls, roasted vegetables, eggs.

### Salsa Verde
- Parsley and/or cilantro, capers, anchovies (optional but incredible), garlic, Dijon mustard, red wine vinegar, olive oil.
- Chop fine or pulse in processor. Should be loose and spoonable, not a paste.
- **Keeps:** 5-7 days refrigerated.
- **Use on:** Fish, chicken, roasted vegetables, boiled potatoes, a spoon straight from the jar.

### Zhug (Yemeni Green Sauce)
- Cilantro, jalapenos or serranos, garlic, cumin, cardamom, olive oil, lemon juice, salt.
- Blend until smooth or slightly chunky.
- **Keeps:** 1 week refrigerated.
- **Use on:** Anything that needs heat and freshness. Falafel, grilled meat, eggs, hummus.

## Quick Preserved Vegetables

Tangy, crunchy vegetable toppings add acid and texture to any dish.

### Quick-Brined Red Onions
- Thinly slice a red onion. Cover with equal parts vinegar and warm water, plus a pinch of sugar and salt.
- Ready in 30 minutes. Peak at 24 hours.
- **Keeps:** 2-3 weeks refrigerated.
- **Use on:** Tacos, grain bowls, sandwiches, salads, burgers, braised meat.

### Quick-Brined Jalapenos
- Slice jalapenos. Cover with vinegar, water, sugar, and salt. Add garlic cloves and cumin seeds if desired.
- Ready in 1 hour.
- **Keeps:** 3-4 weeks refrigerated.
- **Use on:** Tacos, nachos, sandwiches, burgers, grain bowls.

## Cooked Grains

A container of cooked grains in the fridge is an instant meal foundation. Cook a big batch, store it, and use all week.

| Grain | Cook Ratio (grain:water) | Time | Storage Life | Notes |
|-------|--------------------------|------|-------------|-------|
| White rice | 1:1.5 | 18 min | 4-5 days | Rinse before cooking to remove excess starch |
| Brown rice | 1:2 | 40-45 min | 4-5 days | More nutritious, nuttier flavor |
| Quinoa | 1:1.75 | 15 min | 4-5 days | Rinse to remove bitter saponins |
| Farro | 1:2.5 | 25-30 min | 5 days | Chewy, nutty, holds texture well |
| Couscous | 1:1 (pour boiling water, cover) | 5 min | 4-5 days | Fastest grain, almost instant |

**Pro tip:** Season the cooking water. Salt it like pasta water. Add a bay leaf or a garlic clove. The grain absorbs flavor from the start.

## Roasted Vegetables

Roast a sheet pan (or two) of vegetables at 425F / 220C. Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread in a single layer. Roast 25-35 minutes until browned and tender.

**Best for prepping:** Broccoli, cauliflower, sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, bell peppers, carrots, zucchini, mushrooms.

**Keeps:** 4-5 days refrigerated. Reheat in a pan (better texture than microwave) or eat cold in salads.

## Shredded Proteins

Cooked, shredded or sliced protein is the most versatile meal-prep component.

**Best candidates:**
- **Roast chicken** — roast a whole chicken or a tray of thighs. Shred when cool. Use in bowls, salads, wraps, tacos, soups.
- **Braised pork shoulder** — shred and store in its braising liquid. Carnitas, tacos, sandwiches, fried rice.
- **Poached or baked salmon** — flake and use in grain bowls, salads, or pasta.

**Keeps:** 3-4 days refrigerated. Store in braising liquid or a bit of stock to prevent drying out.

## Compound Butters

Butter mixed with aromatics, rolled into a log, and sliced to order. Melted on a hot steak, a piece of fish, steamed vegetables, or toast, it is an instant sauce.

**Combinations:**
- Herb butter: softened butter + parsley + chives + garlic + lemon zest + salt
- Miso butter: softened butter + white miso + a touch of honey
- Anchovy butter: softened butter + mashed anchovies + lemon zest + parsley
- Spiced butter: softened butter + cumin + smoked paprika + lime zest + cilantro

**Method:** Mix all ingredients into softened butter. Roll into a log in plastic wrap or parchment. Refrigerate or freeze. Slice rounds as needed.

**Keeps:** 2 weeks refrigerated, 3 months frozen.

## Dressings

A good dressing transforms a bowl of leftovers into a deliberate meal.

### Tahini Dressing
- Tahini, lemon juice, garlic, water (to thin), salt.
- Whisk until smooth and pourable. Adjust consistency with water.
- **Keeps:** 1 week. May thicken in the fridge — loosen with water.
- **Use on:** Grain bowls, roasted vegetables, falafel plates, salads.

### Miso-Ginger Dressing
- White miso, rice vinegar, sesame oil, grated ginger, a touch of honey, water.
- Whisk until smooth.
- **Keeps:** 1-2 weeks.
- **Use on:** Asian-inspired bowls, salads, cold noodles, steamed vegetables.

### Simple Vinaigrette
- 3 parts olive oil, 1 part vinegar (sherry, red wine, or lemon juice), 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, salt, pepper.
- Shake in a jar. Done.
- **Keeps:** 2 weeks. Shake before using.

## Quick Assembly Ideas

With these components, weeknight dinner becomes:

- **Grain bowl:** Rice + roasted vegetables + shredded chicken + chimichurri + brined onions
- **Salad plate:** Greens + quinoa + salmon + tahini dressing + any roasted vegetable
- **Taco night:** Warm tortillas + shredded pork + brined onions + salsa verde
- **Noodle bowl:** Cooked noodles + miso-ginger dressing + whatever vegetables and protein are on hand
- **Toast dinner:** Good bread + compound butter + a fried egg + roasted vegetables

Each of these takes under 10 minutes to assemble. That is the power of having components ready.
