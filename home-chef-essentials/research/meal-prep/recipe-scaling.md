# Recipe Scaling

## The Question

You found a recipe that serves 4 but you need to feed 8 — or just yourself. Why does simply doubling everything not always work, and what do you need to adjust when scaling recipes up or down?

## The Core Principle: Not Everything Scales Linearly

Doubling a recipe means 2x the main ingredients. But some elements — seasonings, cooking time, surface area — follow different rules. Understanding which components scale linearly and which do not is the difference between a successful scaled recipe and a disaster.

## What Scales Linearly

These components can be multiplied directly:

- **Main proteins** — Double the recipe, double the chicken.
- **Vegetables** — Double the recipe, double the onions.
- **Liquids (in most savory cooking)** — Double the stock for double the soup.
- **Fats for cooking** — Generally scales, though you may need slightly less proportionally in larger batches (a bigger pot has relatively less surface area).
- **Starches** — Double the rice, double the pasta.

## What Does NOT Scale Linearly

### Spices and Salt

This is the most common scaling mistake. Double the cayenne in a recipe and the dish may be intolerably hot. Spices and salt should be scaled at roughly **1.5x for a 2x recipe** and then adjusted by tasting.

**Why:** Your perception of spice and salt is not linear. The relationship between concentration and perceived intensity follows a curve, not a straight line. Additionally, in a larger batch, flavors have more time to develop and concentrate.

**The rule:** Scale spices and salt at 1.5x, then taste and adjust. You can always add more. You cannot take it out.

### Leavening (in Baking)

This is critical for baking. Baking soda and baking powder should be scaled at about **1.5x for a 2x recipe** in most cases. Too much leavening creates a metallic taste and can cause over-rising followed by collapse.

**Yeast** scales somewhat more linearly, but doubling the yeast will speed up fermentation. If you double the yeast, you may need to reduce the rise time or increase the flour proportionally.

### Cooking Time

Doubling a recipe rarely means doubling the cooking time. Time changes are driven by the **thickness** of what you are cooking, not the total amount.

- **A larger batch of soup in a bigger pot:** Similar cook time (the individual pieces are the same size).
- **A bigger roast:** Longer cook time (the center is farther from the heat).
- **Double the cookies on two sheet pans:** Similar cook time per pan, but ovens may need rotation for even heating.

**The principle:** Cooking time is governed by the distance heat must travel to reach the center of the food. Volume (amount) is much less important than thickness.

### Aromatics

Garlic, ginger, onions, and other aromatics are often specified generously in recipes. When scaling up, use about **1.5x for a 2x recipe**. Their flavor compounds are potent, and overscaling makes the dish one-dimensional.

## Surface Area to Volume — The Hidden Variable

This is the physics that explains most scaling issues.

When you double the volume of food in a pot, the surface area (the part exposed to heat) does not double — it increases by a smaller factor. This means:

- **Browning takes longer** in a bigger batch because there is relatively less surface area for evaporation and Maillard reactions.
- **Reduction takes longer** because less surface is exposed to air for evaporation.
- **Searing must be done in batches** even for a scaled recipe — crowding is worse, not better, with more food.

**Practical implication:** If you are doubling a recipe that calls for searing meat, plan to sear in more batches, not bigger ones. If a sauce needs to reduce by half, it will take longer in a bigger pot.

## Baking Scaling — Extra Care Required

Baking is the most sensitive to scaling because it relies on precise chemical reactions.

**Rules for scaling baked goods:**

1. **Weigh everything.** Volume measurements compound errors when scaled.
2. **Scale flour, sugar, eggs, butter linearly** — these are structural and generally scale directly.
3. **Scale leavening at 1.5x** for a 2x recipe.
4. **Scale salt and spices at 1.5x** and adjust.
5. **Pan size matters enormously.** A doubled cake recipe in the same pan will be twice as thick, requiring a lower oven temperature (reduce by 25F) and significantly longer baking time. Better to use two pans of the same size.
6. **Eggs are tricky to halve.** A recipe calling for 1 egg halved means... half an egg? Beat the egg, weigh it, and use half by weight. Or adjust the recipe to use egg yolk or egg white only.

## Weight vs. Volume — Use Weight

This is the single most important scaling tip: **use a kitchen scale.**

| Ingredient | 1 Cup Volume | Weight |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| All-purpose flour | Can vary 120-160g depending on scooping | 125g (standardized) |
| Granulated sugar | 200g | Consistent |
| Brown sugar | 200-220g (packed vs. loose) | Use weight |
| Butter | 227g (2 sticks) | Consistent |
| Water/milk | 240g | Consistent |

A "cup of flour" can vary by 25% depending on whether you scoop, spoon, or sift. At 1x this might not matter. At 4x, that variance compounds into a completely different recipe.

## Practical Conversion Tables

### Common Scaling Factors

| Original | Scaled | Main Ingredients | Spices/Salt | Leavening |
|----------|--------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| Serves 4 | Serves 2 | 0.5x | 0.6x | 0.6x |
| Serves 4 | Serves 6 | 1.5x | 1.3x | 1.3x |
| Serves 4 | Serves 8 | 2x | 1.5x | 1.5x |
| Serves 4 | Serves 12 | 3x | 2x-2.5x | 2x-2.5x |

### Volume Equivalents

| Measure | Equivalent |
|---------|-----------|
| 1 tablespoon | 3 teaspoons |
| 1/4 cup | 4 tablespoons |
| 1/3 cup | 5 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon |
| 1/2 cup | 8 tablespoons |
| 1 cup | 16 tablespoons / 8 fluid ounces |
| 1 pint | 2 cups |
| 1 quart | 4 cups |

## The Golden Rule

When in doubt, scale conservatively and adjust. It is always easier to add more salt, more spice, or more liquid than to fix an over-scaled dish. Taste as you go. The recipe is a starting point — your palate is the finishing point.
