# Batch Cooking Strategy

## The Question

How do you eat well all week without spending every evening cooking from scratch — and without resorting to the same sad meal-prep containers of identical food for five days straight? The answer is components, not complete meals.

## The "Components Not Meals" Approach

The biggest mistake in meal prep is cooking five servings of the same complete meal. By Wednesday you are bored. By Thursday you are ordering takeout.

Instead, cook **individual components** — proteins, grains, roasted vegetables, sauces — and mix and match throughout the week. The same roasted chicken becomes a grain bowl on Monday, a salad on Tuesday, tacos on Wednesday, and soup on Thursday. The same rice serves under a stir-fry, beside braised meat, or in a burrito.

**Why this works:**
- **Variety without extra effort.** Five components create dozens of possible combinations.
- **Flexible.** Craving something different? Rearrange the same building blocks.
- **Reduces waste.** Use components in whatever order makes sense, not a rigid schedule.
- **Scales easily.** Cooking for one? Make smaller batches of more components. Family? Scale up the ones everyone likes.

## The Sunday Prep Framework

A 2-hour Sunday session sets up the entire week. Here is a practical framework:

### Hour 1: Start the Oven, Start the Stove

**Oven (the workhorse):**
1. Roast a sheet pan of vegetables (425F / 220C, 25-35 minutes). Choose 2-3 types: broccoli, sweet potatoes, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, bell peppers, zucchini.
2. Simultaneously roast or bake a protein: chicken thighs, a pork tenderloin, a sheet pan of salmon. Temperature and timing can often overlap with the vegetables.

**Stovetop:**
1. Cook a large batch of grains: rice, quinoa, farro, or couscous. Follow package directions, season the cooking water.
2. While grains cook, prepare a sauce or two (see below).

### Hour 2: Cool, Portion, Store

1. Let everything cool slightly (food safety: do not put hot food directly into sealed containers).
2. Shred or slice the protein if applicable.
3. Portion into containers. Keep components separate — mixed together, they get soggy.
4. Make a quick dressing or sauce: vinaigrette, chimichurri, tahini dressing, or a simple yogurt sauce.
5. Wash and prep raw vegetables for snacking and salads: cut carrots, celery, cucumber. Wash and dry greens.

**That is it.** Two hours, and you have the building blocks for 15-20 meals.

## What to Prep vs. What to Cook Fresh

### Prep-Ahead (keeps 4-5 days)
- Roasted vegetables
- Cooked grains (rice, quinoa, farro)
- Shredded or sliced cooked protein
- Hard-boiled eggs
- Washed and cut raw vegetables
- Sauces and dressings (most keep a week)
- Cooked beans and lentils

### Cook Fresh (tastes better day-of)
- Eggs (scrambled, fried, poached)
- Stir-fries (use prepped components but cook the stir-fry fresh — takes 5 minutes)
- Toast and bread-based items
- Leafy salads (dress at the last minute)
- Pasta (cook the noodle fresh, sauce can be prepped)
- Anything fried or crispy

The principle: anything that relies on texture (crispy, crunchy, freshly cooked) should be finished fresh. Anything that relies on flavor depth (roasted, braised, sauced) keeps well.

## Scaling for One Person vs. Family

### Solo Cooking
- Cook 2 proteins (one roasted, one stovetop) in smaller portions.
- One batch of grains.
- 1-2 sheet pans of vegetables.
- 2 sauces or dressings.
- Expect to eat through components in 3-4 days, then supplement with simple fresh cooking the rest of the week.

### Family (4+)
- Scale proteins up: a whole roast chicken plus a second protein.
- Double the grains.
- 2-3 sheet pans of vegetables (rotate varieties so everyone has options).
- More sauce variety to keep kids and adults happy.
- Consider a pot of soup or stew as a bonus component — it reheats perfectly and is a complete meal on its own.

## The Component Assembly Examples

From the same Sunday prep session (roast chicken, rice, roasted broccoli and sweet potatoes, chimichurri, vinaigrette):

| Day | Assembly | Time |
|-----|----------|------|
| Monday | Grain bowl: rice + roasted vegetables + chicken + chimichurri | 3 min (reheat) |
| Tuesday | Salad: greens + chicken + roasted sweet potato + vinaigrette | 5 min (assembly) |
| Wednesday | Tacos: warm tortillas + shredded chicken + quick slaw + hot sauce | 8 min |
| Thursday | Stir-fry: leftover rice + broccoli + egg + soy sauce (cook fresh) | 10 min |
| Friday | Soup: simmer chicken bones with leftover vegetables + rice in stock | 25 min |

Five different meals, all from the same prep session, none of them boring.

## Storage Best Practices

- **Glass containers** with locking lids are ideal — they do not stain, reheat well, and last.
- **Keep components separate** until assembly. Mixed bowls get soggy.
- **Label with the date** if you are making multiple batches.
- **Stack grains and proteins at the bottom** of the fridge where it is coldest.
- **Sauces in small jars** — mason jars or repurposed glass jars work perfectly.

## The Mental Shift

Meal prep is not about eating the same thing every day. It is about doing the labor-intensive work once so that weeknight cooking becomes assembly. When you have prepped components in the fridge, the question shifts from "what do I make for dinner?" to "what do I feel like assembling?" — and that shift is the difference between cooking feeling like a chore and cooking feeling effortless.

## Getting Started

If a full 2-hour session feels overwhelming, start with just two things:
1. Cook one protein in bulk (roast chicken thighs is the easiest).
2. Cook one batch of grains.

That alone gives you a head start on every meal for 4 days. Add a sauce and a vegetable the following week. Build the habit gradually and it becomes second nature.
