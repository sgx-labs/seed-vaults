# Emulsions and Sauces

## The Question

Why does your vinaigrette separate, your hollandaise break, and your pan sauce look greasy? Emulsions are at the heart of sauce-making, and once you understand why oil and water can be convinced to get along, sauces stop being mysterious.

## What Is an Emulsion?

An emulsion is a stable mixture of two liquids that normally do not mix — typically oil and water. One liquid is dispersed as tiny droplets throughout the other. The droplets are so small they stay suspended instead of separating.

- **Oil-in-water:** Tiny oil droplets suspended in water. Vinaigrettes, milk, mayonnaise, pan sauces. These tend to feel lighter and less greasy.
- **Water-in-oil:** Tiny water droplets suspended in oil. Butter is the classic example. These feel richer and more coating.

## Why Emulsions Need Help

Oil and water naturally repel each other. Left alone, they separate — oil floats, water sinks. To make them stay together, you need two things:

**1. Mechanical energy** — Whisking, blending, or shaking breaks one liquid into tiny droplets. The smaller the droplets, the more stable the emulsion. This is why a blender makes a more stable vinaigrette than a fork.

**2. An emulsifier** — A molecule with one end that loves water and one end that loves oil. It sits at the boundary between each droplet and the surrounding liquid, preventing them from merging back together.

**Common kitchen emulsifiers:**
- **Lecithin** (in egg yolks) — the powerhouse emulsifier in mayonnaise and hollandaise
- **Mustard** — contains mucilage that stabilizes vinaigrettes
- **Gelatin** (in good stock) — stabilizes pan sauces and makes them silky
- **Starch** (in pasta water) — helps pasta sauces come together
- **Casein** (in dairy) — stabilizes cream sauces

## Pan Sauces — The Everyday Emulsion

A pan sauce is the most practical emulsion technique. After searing protein, you have fond (browned bits) in a hot pan. In four steps you have a restaurant-quality sauce:

1. **Deglaze:** Add wine, stock, or another liquid to the hot pan. Scrape up the fond. Those are concentrated Maillard reaction flavors.
2. **Reduce:** Simmer until the liquid is reduced by half or more. This concentrates flavor and increases the ratio of gelatin (if using stock) to liquid.
3. **Mount with butter:** Off heat or on very low heat, swirl in cold butter one tablespoon at a time. The butter melts into the sauce, creating a creamy emulsion. The cold butter emulsifies more reliably than room-temperature butter.
4. **Season:** Salt, pepper, a squeeze of lemon, fresh herbs.

**Why stock matters:** Gelatin-rich stock (from homemade or quality commercial stock) acts as an emulsifier. It makes the sauce silky and helps it cling to food. If your stock does not jiggle when cold, your pan sauces will be thinner.

## Vinaigrettes

The classic ratio is 3 parts oil to 1 part acid (vinegar or citrus). But ratios are personal — start there and adjust.

**A stable vinaigrette:**
1. Start with the acid in a bowl.
2. Add salt, mustard (the emulsifier), and any aromatics (shallot, garlic, herbs).
3. Slowly drizzle oil while whisking constantly. The slow addition creates smaller droplets.
4. Taste and adjust — more acid? More salt? A pinch of sugar to balance harsh vinegar?

**Kenji's blender technique:** For a vinaigrette that stays emulsified for days, use an immersion blender or jar blender. The mechanical force creates microscopic droplets that resist separating.

## Mayonnaise

Mayonnaise is the ultimate oil-in-water emulsion — roughly 80% oil suspended in a small amount of lemon juice and egg yolk. It should not work (that much oil in that little water?), but lecithin in the egg yolk is a phenomenal emulsifier.

**Kenji's immersion blender method:**
1. Put one egg yolk, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 teaspoon mustard, and a pinch of salt in a narrow container.
2. Add 1 cup neutral oil on top.
3. Place the immersion blender at the bottom and blend without moving for 15 seconds.
4. Slowly raise the blender to incorporate the remaining oil.

Result: perfect mayonnaise in 30 seconds. It works because the blender creates the emulsion from the bottom up, incorporating oil gradually.

## Beurre Blanc

A warm emulsion of butter in a small amount of acidic liquid. Elegant, rich, and simpler than it sounds.

1. Reduce white wine and shallots until nearly dry (2-3 tablespoons liquid remaining).
2. Over very low heat, whisk in cold butter one tablespoon at a time.
3. Each addition should melt into a creamy sauce, not a pool of grease.
4. The temperature must stay between 140-180F / 60-82C. Too hot and the butter separates. Too cool and it solidifies.

## Hollandaise

Hollandaise is an emulsion of clarified butter in egg yolk, stabilized by lecithin and kept together by gentle heat.

**Method:**
1. Whisk egg yolks with lemon juice and a splash of water over a double boiler (or a bowl over simmering water).
2. Whisk constantly until the yolks thicken and lighten in color (160F / 71C).
3. Remove from heat. Slowly drizzle in warm clarified butter while whisking.
4. Season with salt, cayenne, and more lemon juice to taste.

**Hollandaise troubleshooting:**

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Sauce broke (oily mess) | Too hot, or butter added too fast | Whisk a fresh yolk in a clean bowl, slowly drizzle the broken sauce into it |
| Too thick | Over-reduced, or too much yolk | Whisk in warm water, a teaspoon at a time |
| Scrambled bits | Eggs got too hot | Strain through a fine mesh sieve and continue |
| Won't thicken | Yolks not cooked enough | Return to gentle heat, whisk until thickened |

## Why Sauces Break and the Universal Fix

Emulsions break when the droplets merge back together — usually because of temperature shock, too-vigorous whisking after the emulsion forms, or running out of emulsifier.

**The universal rescue:** Start fresh with a new emulsifier base (an egg yolk, a spoonful of mustard, or a splash of warm water) in a clean bowl. Slowly whisk the broken sauce into the new base. You are re-emulsifying the existing mixture into a new, stable emulsion.

This works for broken hollandaise, split cream sauces, and separated vinaigrettes. It works because you are providing fresh emulsifier molecules and rebuilding the droplet structure from scratch.

## The Pasta Water Secret

Reserved pasta water is liquid gold. The starch dissolved in it acts as an emulsifier. When you toss pasta with sauce and a splash of pasta water, the starch helps the fat and water components come together into a glossy, clinging sauce instead of a greasy puddle.

This is why Italian cooks insist on finishing pasta in the sauce with a ladle of cooking water. It is not just about loosening — it is about emulsification.
