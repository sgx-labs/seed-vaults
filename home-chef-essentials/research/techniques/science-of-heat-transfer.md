# The Science of Heat Transfer

## The Question

Why do some cooking methods produce a deep golden crust while others leave food pale and steaming? Understanding the three modes of heat transfer gives you a mental model for every cooking technique you will ever use.

## The Three Modes

### Conduction — Direct Contact

Conduction is heat flowing from one solid surface to another through direct contact. A steak on a screaming-hot cast iron skillet. A pancake on a griddle. Heat transfers from the pan's metal into the food's surface.

**Why it matters:** Conduction is the fastest way to deliver intense, surface-level heat. That is why pan-searing produces the deepest browning. The tighter the contact between food and pan, the better the heat transfer — which is why you press a burger down and why flat-bottomed pans outperform warped ones.

**Practical tips:**
- Preheat the pan until water droplets skitter across the surface (the Leidenfrost effect — see below).
- Use a heavy pan. More thermal mass means the temperature recovers faster when cold food hits it.
- Pat proteins dry with paper towels. Every molecule of surface water must evaporate (at 212F/100C) before the surface can climb past 280F/140C where browning begins.

### Convection — Moving Fluid (Air or Liquid)

Convection is heat carried by a moving fluid — hot air in an oven, hot oil surrounding a piece of fried chicken, simmering water around a poached egg.

**Why it matters:** Moving fluid surrounds food on all sides, cooking more evenly than conduction alone. Convection ovens use a fan to force air circulation, cooking roughly 25% faster than still ovens. Deep frying is so efficient because oil is denser than air, carries far more thermal energy, and surrounds the food completely.

**Practical tips:**
- In a conventional oven, rotate pans halfway through for even cooking.
- When deep frying, maintain oil temperature (usually 350-375F/175-190C). Cold food drops the temp; fry in small batches.
- Boiling and simmering are convection too — a gentle simmer (180-200F/82-93C) is almost always better than a rolling boil for delicate proteins.

### Radiation — Electromagnetic Energy

Radiation is heat transmitted through electromagnetic waves without needing a medium. Your broiler, your grill's glowing coals, a wood-fired pizza oven's ceiling — all radiate infrared energy directly onto food.

**Why it matters:** Radiation is intensely directional. It heats whatever surface faces the source. This is why broiling browns the top of a casserole without heating the bottom, and why one side of your hand feels the campfire while the other stays cool.

**Practical tips:**
- Broiling is essentially an upside-down grill. Position the oven rack 4-6 inches from the element and watch closely — the difference between perfect and burnt can be 30 seconds.
- Grilling combines radiation (from coals) and conduction (from grates). Those grill marks are conduction; the overall cooking between the marks is radiation.
- For thick cuts on the grill, use indirect heat (move food away from the coals) to cook through gently, then finish over direct heat for the crust.

## Why Dry Surfaces Brown Better

Browning (the Maillard reaction) requires surface temperatures above 280F/140C. Water boils at 212F/100C. As long as there is moisture on the surface, the temperature is stuck at or near 212F — the energy goes into turning water to steam instead of browning the food.

This is the single most impactful cooking insight for a home cook: **dry your food before it hits the heat.**

- Pat steaks and chicken dry with paper towels.
- Let proteins rest uncovered in the fridge for an hour (or overnight) to dry the surface.
- Salt proteins ahead of time — salt draws moisture out, then the moisture reabsorbs, but the surface dries.

## Why Crowding the Pan Steams Instead of Sears

When you overload a pan, each piece of food releases moisture. That moisture has nowhere to go — it pools, the pan temperature plummets below 212F, and you are now steaming in a shallow puddle instead of searing.

**The fix:** Cook in batches. Leave at least an inch between pieces. Your patience will be rewarded with an actual crust instead of a gray, rubbery surface.

Kenji Lopez-Alt demonstrates this principle repeatedly in The Food Lab: a properly spaced pan recovers heat quickly and browns aggressively. A crowded pan never gets there.

## The Leidenfrost Effect

Drop water onto a very hot pan (above roughly 400F/200C) and the droplets levitate and skitter. The bottom of the droplet vaporizes instantly, creating a thin cushion of steam that insulates the rest. This is the Leidenfrost effect.

**In the kitchen:** When water dances on your pan instead of immediately evaporating, the pan is hot enough for searing. If it just sizzles and evaporates, give it another minute. If it sits there calmly, the pan is not yet hot enough.

## Combining Methods

Most great cooking uses multiple heat transfer modes:
- **Braising** — sear (conduction), then oven-cook in liquid (convection).
- **Roasting** — oven air (convection) plus the hot sheet pan underneath (conduction) plus broiler finish (radiation).
- **Stir-frying** — wok surface (conduction) plus radiant heat from the burner walls in a wok.

Understanding which mode dominates at each stage lets you troubleshoot: if the bottom is burning but the top is pale, you have too much conduction and not enough convection or radiation. Adjust your technique accordingly.

## Key Temperatures to Remember

| Threshold | Temperature | Significance |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Water boils | 212F / 100C | Surface moisture ceiling |
| Maillard begins | 280F / 140C | Browning and flavor development |
| Caramelization | 320F+ / 160C+ | Sugar browning |
| Leidenfrost point | ~400F / 200C | Water dances — pan is ready |
| Smoke points vary | 350-520F / 175-270C | Depends on the oil |

Master heat transfer and you will never wonder why something did not brown. You will know.
