# Asian Stir-Fry and Noodle Fundamentals

## The Question

Why does your home stir-fry taste nothing like the one from your favorite restaurant? The answer is almost always heat, timing, and preparation — not secret ingredients. Wok cooking is one of the most technique-driven styles of cooking, and once you understand the principles, restaurant-quality stir-fry is achievable at home.

## Wok Hei — The Breath of the Wok

Wok hei is the elusive, smoky, slightly charred flavor that defines great stir-fried food. It comes from food making brief, intense contact with a wok surface that is far hotter than any typical home burner reaches.

In professional kitchens, woks sit over jet-engine burners producing 100,000+ BTUs. A home stove produces 10,000-15,000 BTUs. This means you must compensate:

**Strategies for home wok hei:**
- **Preheat aggressively.** Heat the wok until it smokes, then add oil. The oil should shimmer immediately.
- **Cook in small batches.** A crowded wok drops the temperature and steams instead of sears. Cook protein first, remove it, cook vegetables, then combine. Kenji Lopez-Alt's wok cookbook is built around this principle.
- **Use a flat-bottomed carbon steel wok on a gas burner** for the best home results. (Round-bottomed woks need a wok ring or a commercial burner.)
- **High-smoke-point oil.** Peanut oil (traditional), avocado oil, or refined coconut oil. Not olive oil, not sesame oil (that is a finishing oil).
- **Do not stir constantly.** Let the food sit against the wok surface for 10-15 seconds to develop browning, then toss. "Stir-fry" is somewhat misleading — it is more like "sear-toss."

## Mise en Place Is Mandatory

This is the one cooking style where preparation is absolutely non-negotiable. Once you start cooking, everything happens in 3-5 minutes. If you are still chopping while the garlic burns, the dish is lost.

**Before turning on the heat:**
1. All proteins sliced thin and marinated (if applicable).
2. All vegetables cut to uniform size (thin pieces cook fast; thick pieces do not).
3. Aromatics minced: garlic, ginger, scallion whites.
4. Sauce mixed in a bowl (see below).
5. Rice or noodles cooked or ready.
6. Everything within arm's reach.

## The Stir-Fry Formula

Nearly every stir-fry follows the same sequence:

### 1. Protein First
- Season or marinate: soy sauce, rice wine (shaoxing), cornstarch (creates a velvety coating called velveting).
- Wok screaming hot + oil. Add protein in a single layer. Let it sear 30-60 seconds without touching.
- Toss and cook until just done. Remove from wok. Set aside.

### 2. Aromatics
- Add a splash more oil. Add minced garlic, ginger, and scallion whites.
- Cook 15-20 seconds until fragrant. Not brown. This happens fast.

### 3. Vegetables
- Hardest vegetables first (carrots, broccoli stems), then softer ones (snap peas, peppers, leafy greens).
- Toss frequently. 1-3 minutes total. They should be crisp-tender, not soft.

### 4. Sauce
- Pour in the pre-mixed sauce. It hits the hot wok and reduces almost instantly.
- Return the protein.
- Toss everything together for 30-60 seconds until the sauce coats evenly and thickens.

### 5. Finish
- Sesame oil (a few drops — it is potent).
- Scallion greens.
- Serve immediately. Stir-fry does not wait.

## Sauce Building — The Ratios

Most stir-fry sauces are variations on a base formula:

**The basic sauce (for 2 servings):**
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce (the backbone)
- 1 tablespoon rice wine or dry sherry (depth, sweetness)
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil (nutty aroma)
- 1 teaspoon sugar or honey (balances salt and acid)
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch dissolved in 2 tablespoons water (thickens the sauce so it coats)

**Variations by adding:**
- Oyster sauce: Rich, savory, slightly sweet. The most common Chinese restaurant sauce base.
- Hoisin sauce: Sweet, thick, complex. Good for glazes.
- Black bean sauce: Fermented, earthy, deeply savory.
- Chili paste (sambal, gochujang, chili garlic sauce): Heat.
- Fish sauce: Umami depth (Southeast Asian direction).

**The pattern:** Salty (soy) + Sweet (sugar/mirin) + Aromatic (sesame) + Depth (oyster/fish sauce) + Thickener (cornstarch slurry). Adjust the ratios to your taste.

## Noodle Types and When to Use Each

| Noodle | Made From | Texture | Best For |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Lo mein (egg noodles) | Wheat + egg | Chewy, rich | Tossed with sauce and vegetables |
| Chow mein (thin wheat) | Wheat | Crispy when pan-fried | Pan-fried until crispy, sauce on top |
| Rice noodles (pad thai, pho) | Rice flour | Tender, slippery | Soups, pad thai, stir-fry (soak, do not boil) |
| Udon | Wheat | Thick, chewy | Soup, stir-fry, yaki udon |
| Soba | Buckwheat | Nutty, delicate | Cold with dipping sauce, in broth |
| Ramen | Wheat + alkaline water | Springy, yellow | In broth, stir-fried (yakisoba style) |
| Glass noodles (cellophane) | Mung bean starch | Transparent, slippery | Soups, spring rolls, stir-fry |

**Key noodle rules:**
- **Do not overcook.** Asian noodles should be al dente — they continue softening in the sauce.
- **Rinse wheat noodles** with cold water after cooking to stop cooking and prevent sticking (for stir-fry applications, not soup).
- **Rice noodles:** Soak in room temperature water until pliable (20-30 minutes), do not boil. They go from perfect to mush in seconds.
- **Oil lightly** after draining to prevent clumping.

## Essential Ingredients for Asian Cooking

| Ingredient | Role | Shelf Life |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| Soy sauce (regular and dark) | Salt + umami backbone | Months (refrigerate after opening) |
| Rice vinegar | Acid, brightness | Months |
| Shaoxing rice wine | Depth, deglazing | Months (in pantry) |
| Sesame oil (toasted) | Finishing aroma | Months (refrigerate to prevent rancidity) |
| Oyster sauce | Rich, savory glaze | Months (refrigerate) |
| Fish sauce | Umami depth | Years |
| Sambal or chili garlic sauce | Heat | Months |
| Cornstarch | Sauce thickener, velveting | Years |
| Fresh ginger | Aromatics | 3-4 weeks (fridge) or freeze |
| Garlic | Aromatics | Weeks |
| Scallions | Garnish + aromatics | 1 week |

## Velveting — The Restaurant Secret

Velveting is the technique that makes Chinese restaurant chicken and beef so impossibly tender. It coats thin-sliced protein in a mixture of cornstarch, egg white, and sometimes oil, then briefly pre-cooks it.

**Simple velveting method:**
1. Slice protein thin (1/4 inch or thinner, against the grain for beef).
2. Toss with 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, and 1 teaspoon oil.
3. Let sit 15-30 minutes.
4. Stir-fry as the first step in your wok sequence.

The cornstarch coating creates a slippery barrier that protects the protein from overcooking and gives it that distinctive silky texture.

## The Home Cook's Advantage

You will never replicate a restaurant wok burner at home. But you can produce excellent stir-fry by:
1. Prepping everything before the wok gets hot.
2. Cooking in small batches (never more than a single layer in the wok).
3. Using the highest heat your burner produces.
4. Not stirring constantly — let the food contact the metal.
5. Having your sauce ready to pour.
6. Moving fast once you start.

The whole active cooking time is under 5 minutes. The 15 minutes of prep is where the quality is determined.
