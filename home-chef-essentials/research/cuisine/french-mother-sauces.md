# French Mother Sauces and Derivatives

## The Question

What are the five mother sauces of French cuisine, why do they matter, and how do they branch into the hundreds of sauces that define Western cooking? Understanding these foundations means you can improvise any sauce, because every sauce you have ever tasted in a French or Continental restaurant descends from one of these five.

## The Concept of Mother Sauces

Auguste Escoffier codified the five mother sauces in the early 20th century. Each is a starting point from which dozens of derivative sauces (called "small sauces" or "daughter sauces") are built by adding specific ingredients.

Master the five mothers and you have the key to an entire universe of sauces.

## Roux — The Foundation Technique

Three of the five mother sauces begin with a roux: equal parts fat (usually butter) and flour, cooked together.

**How to make a roux:**
1. Melt butter over medium heat.
2. Add an equal amount of flour by weight (roughly equal by volume).
3. Stir constantly with a whisk or wooden spoon.
4. Cook to the desired color:
   - **White roux** (2-3 minutes): Bubbling, no color. For bechamel and veloute.
   - **Blond roux** (4-5 minutes): Slightly golden, nutty aroma. For veloute variations.
   - **Brown roux** (8-15 minutes): Deep brown, intensely nutty. For espagnole and Cajun cooking.

**The science:** Flour's starch granules absorb liquid and swell when heated, thickening the sauce. The longer you cook the roux, the more flavor develops — but also the less thickening power it has (heat breaks down some starch). A dark roux needs more quantity to achieve the same thickness as a white roux.

## The Five Mother Sauces

### 1. Bechamel (Milk + White Roux)

The simplest mother sauce. White roux + milk, simmered until smooth and thickened.

**Method:**
1. Make a white roux (2 tablespoons butter + 2 tablespoons flour).
2. Gradually whisk in 2 cups warm milk, adding in a steady stream.
3. Simmer 8-10 minutes, whisking occasionally, until it coats the back of a spoon.
4. Season with salt, white pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg.

**Derivative sauces:**
| Sauce | Add to Bechamel |
|-------|----------------|
| Mornay | Gruyere and/or Parmesan (the classic cheese sauce) |
| Soubise | Cooked onion puree |
| Cream sauce | Heavy cream |
| Mustard sauce | Dijon mustard |

**Used in:** Lasagna, mac and cheese (Mornay), gratins, croque monsieur, creamed vegetables.

### 2. Veloute (White Stock + Blond Roux)

Veloute means "velvety." It is a blond roux + white stock (chicken, fish, or veal).

**Method:**
1. Make a blond roux.
2. Gradually whisk in warm white stock.
3. Simmer 30-45 minutes, skimming any foam. The long simmer removes the raw flour taste and concentrates flavor.
4. Strain through a fine mesh sieve.

**Derivative sauces:**
| Sauce | Add to Veloute |
|-------|---------------|
| Supreme | Cream + mushroom essence (reduced mushroom cooking liquid) |
| Allemande | Egg yolks + lemon juice |
| Bercy | Shallots + white wine + fish stock |
| Normande | Cider + cream (Normandy-style) |

**Used in:** Pot pies, blanquette de veau, fish dishes, cream of mushroom soup.

### 3. Espagnole (Brown Stock + Brown Roux + Tomato)

The richest, most complex mother sauce. Brown roux + rich brown stock + tomato puree, simmered for hours.

**Method:**
1. Make a brown roux with clarified butter.
2. Add mirepoix (onion, carrot, celery), cook until caramelized.
3. Add tomato paste, cook 2-3 minutes.
4. Gradually whisk in rich brown stock (ideally veal or beef).
5. Simmer 3-4 hours, skimming regularly. Strain.

**Key derivative — Demi-Glace:**
Equal parts espagnole and rich brown stock, reduced by half. Demi-glace is the most prized sauce in French cuisine: concentrated, glossy, deeply savory. A spoonful transforms a pan sauce into something extraordinary.

**Other derivatives:**
| Sauce | Add to Espagnole/Demi-Glace |
|-------|----------------------------|
| Bordelaise | Red wine + shallots + bone marrow |
| Robert | White wine + onion + mustard |
| Chasseur (Hunter) | Mushrooms + tomatoes + white wine |
| Madeira | Madeira wine |

**Used in:** Steak sauces, braised dishes, the foundation of fine dining meat preparations.

### 4. Hollandaise (Egg Yolk + Clarified Butter + Acid)

The only mother sauce not thickened by roux. Hollandaise is a warm emulsion — egg yolks whisked with acid (lemon juice) over gentle heat, then enriched with clarified butter.

**Method:**
1. Whisk egg yolks and lemon juice over a double boiler until thick and doubled in volume.
2. Remove from heat. Slowly drizzle in warm clarified butter while whisking.
3. Season with salt, cayenne, and more lemon juice.
4. Serve immediately (hollandaise does not hold well).

**Derivative sauces:**
| Sauce | Add to Hollandaise |
|-------|-------------------|
| Bearnaise | Tarragon + shallot reduction (tarragon vinegar) |
| Mousseline | Whipped cream (lighter, fluffier) |
| Choron | Tomato paste (pink, for grilled fish) |
| Maltaise | Blood orange juice (seasonal) |

**Used in:** Eggs Benedict, asparagus, fish, steak (bearnaise).

### 5. Tomato Sauce (Tomatoes + Stock + Aromatics)

The French version is more refined than the Italian: tomatoes are cooked with stock, a roux or pork, and aromatics, then strained smooth.

**Method:**
1. Render salt pork or bacon. Add mirepoix, cook until soft.
2. Add tomato puree, stock, garlic, and a bouquet garni.
3. Simmer 1-2 hours. Strain if desired.
4. Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar if needed.

**Derivative sauces:**
| Sauce | Add to Tomato |
|-------|--------------|
| Creole | Peppers + onion + celery + garlic |
| Portugaise | Garlic + onion + additional tomato + parsley |
| Provencale | Garlic + olives + mushrooms |

**Used in:** Pasta, braised dishes, eggs, as a base for countless other preparations.

## How to Rescue Broken Sauces

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Lumpy bechamel/veloute | Flour clumped when liquid was added | Whisk vigorously, or strain through a fine sieve |
| Broken hollandaise | Too hot, or butter added too fast | Start with a fresh yolk in a clean bowl, slowly whisk the broken sauce into it |
| Thin sauce | Not enough roux, or not reduced enough | Simmer to reduce, or whisk in a beurre manie (equal parts soft butter and flour, kneaded together) |
| Grainy sauce | Overheated cheese (in Mornay) | Add cheese off heat, stir gently until melted |
| Too thick | Too much roux relative to liquid | Whisk in warm stock or milk until desired consistency |

## Why This Matters

You do not need to make demi-glace from scratch (though it is a worthy project). The value of understanding mother sauces is that they reveal the architecture of all sauce-making:

- **A thickener** (roux, egg, reduction)
- **A liquid** (stock, milk, butter)
- **Flavor additions** (wine, mustard, cheese, herbs)

Once you see this structure, you can build any sauce intuitively. A pan sauce is a miniature espagnole derivative. A cream soup is a casual veloute. Mac and cheese is bechamel with cheese (Mornay). You already know more about sauces than you realized.
