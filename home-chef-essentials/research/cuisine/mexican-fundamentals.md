# Mexican Cooking Fundamentals

## The Question

What are the building blocks of Mexican cooking, and how do you build the deep, layered flavors at home? Mexican cuisine is one of the most sophisticated in the world — far beyond tacos and burritos — built on a foundation of chiles, corn, and time-tested techniques.

## The Building Blocks

### Dried Chiles — The Flavor Foundation

Dried chiles are to Mexican cooking what wine is to French cooking: the ingredient that provides depth, complexity, and character. They are not primarily about heat — most dried chiles are mild to moderate. They are about flavor.

**Essential dried chiles:**

| Chile | Heat Level | Flavor Profile | Used In |
|-------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| Ancho (dried poblano) | Mild | Sweet, fruity, raisin-like | Mole, enchilada sauce, general use |
| Guajillo | Mild-medium | Bright, tangy, berry-like | Salsas, adobo, general braising |
| Chipotle (dried smoked jalapeno) | Medium | Smoky, earthy, complex | Adobo sauce, marinades, soups |
| Pasilla | Mild | Berry, herbal, slightly bitter | Mole, salsas |
| Chile de arbol | Hot | Sharp, nutty, grassy | Table salsas, infused oils |
| Morita (smoked jalapeno, darker) | Medium | Deep smoke, chocolate notes | Salsas, marinades |

**How to use dried chiles:**
1. **Toast** — Place in a dry skillet over medium heat, pressing flat with a spatula. Toast 15-30 seconds per side until fragrant and slightly puffed. Do not burn (they turn bitter).
2. **Rehydrate** — Stem and seed the toasted chiles. Cover with hot water and soak 20-30 minutes until pliable.
3. **Blend** — Puree the rehydrated chiles with some of the soaking liquid into a smooth paste. This is your chile sauce base.

This toast-rehydrate-blend process is the foundation of enchilada sauce, mole, adobo marinades, and countless other dishes.

### Fresh Salsas

Salsa is not just a condiment — it is an integral part of the meal, providing acid, heat, freshness, and contrast.

**Salsa cruda (raw):**
Diced tomatoes, onion, jalapeno or serrano, cilantro, lime juice, salt. Chop fine or leave chunky. The simplest, freshest expression of salsa.

**Salsa taquera (charred):**
Char tomatoes and chiles (tomatillos, jalapenos, serranos) directly on a comal, under a broiler, or on a gas burner until blackened in spots. Blend with garlic, salt, and water. The charring adds smokiness and depth that raw salsa cannot achieve.

**Salsa verde:**
Tomatillos (husked and rinsed), serranos or jalapenos, garlic, onion. Roast or boil. Blend with cilantro, lime juice, and salt. Bright, tangy, and versatile — works on everything from tacos to enchiladas to eggs.

### Corn Tortillas

The foundation of Mexican cuisine. A fresh corn tortilla made from masa (nixtamalized corn dough) has a sweet, earthy flavor and pliable texture that no store-bought tortilla matches.

**Basic method:**
1. Mix masa harina (Maseca or Bob's Red Mill) with warm water and a pinch of salt. Knead until the dough is smooth and pliable (should feel like Play-Doh).
2. Press into thin rounds using a tortilla press lined with plastic (a cut-open zip-lock bag works).
3. Cook on a dry, hot comal or cast iron skillet. 60-90 seconds per side until lightly charred and puffed.

Even if you never make your own tortillas, seek out the freshest corn tortillas available. A good tortilla shop (tortilleria) transforms the taco experience.

## Layering Flavor — The Mexican Approach

Mexican cooking builds flavor in deliberate layers:

### 1. Bloom Spices in Fat

Before adding liquid or other ingredients, cook ground spices (cumin, coriander, oregano, chili powder) in hot oil or rendered fat for 30-60 seconds. The fat extracts and carries fat-soluble flavor compounds that water cannot reach.

### 2. Build Sauces from Chiles

The chile sauce (from the toast-rehydrate-blend process above) is a flavor concentrate. It provides depth, body, color, and a warmth that goes far beyond simple heat.

### 3. Char Your Vegetables

Charring onions, tomatoes, tomatillos, chiles, and garlic adds smoky, caramelized notes. This technique — called "asar" — appears across Mexican cuisine. Char directly on a comal, under a broiler, or over an open flame.

### 4. Finish with Acid and Fresh Elements

Lime juice (always), fresh cilantro, raw onion, radishes, and salsa are added at the very end. These provide brightness and contrast to the deep, cooked flavors underneath.

**The pattern: fat → spices → chiles/aromatics → protein/liquid → time → acid/fresh garnish.** This layering is what gives Mexican food its extraordinary depth.

## Essential Techniques

### Braising with Chiles

The braised meats of Mexican cooking — carnitas, birria, barbacoa, chile colorado — use chile sauces as the braising medium. The result is protein infused with complex, earthy heat.

**Basic chile-braised meat:**
1. Toast and rehydrate dried chiles (ancho + guajillo is a classic combination).
2. Blend with garlic, onion, cumin, oregano, and some soaking liquid.
3. Sear the meat (pork shoulder for carnitas, beef cheeks for barbacoa).
4. Pour the chile sauce over the meat in a Dutch oven.
5. Braise at 300-325F for 3-4 hours until fork-tender.
6. Shred and serve with tortillas, lime, onion, and cilantro.

### Quick-Brined Red Onions

Thinly sliced red onions soaked in lime juice (or a mix of vinegar and lime) with a pinch of salt. Ready in 30 minutes. A simple garnish that adds acid, crunch, and color to tacos, tostadas, and bowls. Keep a jar in the fridge at all times.

### Charring and Blistering

Charring produce on a dry, ripping-hot surface (comal, cast iron, broiler) develops smoky, complex flavors:
- Tomatoes and tomatillos for salsas.
- Chiles (both fresh and dried) for sauces.
- Corn on the cob for elote or esquites.
- Onions for garnishing tacos (halved, charred cut-side down).

### Rendering and Braising for Carnitas

True carnitas are pork shoulder slow-cooked in its own rendered fat (or lard) until falling apart, then shredded and crisped in a hot pan. The combination of tender, juicy interior and crispy, caramelized exterior is extraordinary.

## The Essential Mexican Pantry

| Ingredient | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Dried chiles (ancho, guajillo, chipotle) | Sauce bases, flavor depth |
| Masa harina | Corn tortillas, tamales, gorditas |
| Cumin | Warm, earthy base spice |
| Mexican oregano | Different from Mediterranean oregano — more citrusy, earthy |
| Limes | Acid on everything, always |
| Cilantro | Fresh herb finish |
| Tomatillos | Salsa verde, green sauces |
| Avocados | Guacamole, garnish |
| White onion | Base aromatics, raw garnish |
| Cotija or queso fresco | Crumbled finishing cheese |
| Canela (Mexican cinnamon) | Softer, sweeter than cassia cinnamon. Used in mole, chocolate, rice. |

## The Spirit of Mexican Cooking

Mexican cuisine is generous, communal, and built on respect for ingredients that have been cultivated for thousands of years. Corn, beans, and chiles are not just food — they are cultural foundations. When you toast a dried ancho chile and the kitchen fills with its sweet, raisin-like aroma, you are participating in a tradition that predates European contact by millennia.

Do not be intimidated by the unfamiliar. Start with a simple charred salsa, try braising with a basic chile sauce, and make fresh tortillas once. The entry point is accessible; the depth is infinite.
