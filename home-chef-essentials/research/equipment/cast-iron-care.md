# Cast Iron Care

## The Question

How do you season cast iron, maintain it, and rescue a neglected pan? Cast iron has a reputation for being fussy, but it is actually one of the most durable and forgiving pieces of cookware you can own. The rules are simpler than the internet makes them seem.

## What Seasoning Actually Is

Seasoning is not a coating you apply once and forget about. It is **polymerized oil** — oil that has been heated past its smoke point, causing it to break down and bond with the iron surface at a molecular level. This creates a hard, smooth, hydrophobic (water-repelling) layer.

Each time you cook with fat in a cast iron pan, you are adding another microscopic layer of polymerized oil. Over time, these layers build into a slick, nearly nonstick surface. A well-seasoned cast iron pan that has been used regularly for years has a surface that rivals any nonstick coating — and unlike nonstick, it gets better with age.

## Initial Seasoning (New Pan or After Stripping)

New Lodge pans come pre-seasoned, but the factory seasoning is thin. Building it up produces better results.

**Method:**
1. Wash the pan with warm soapy water (this is the one time soap is specifically useful — removing the factory residue).
2. Dry completely. Place on a burner over low heat for 2-3 minutes to evaporate all moisture.
3. Apply a **very thin** coat of high-smoke-point oil (flaxseed oil, refined avocado oil, Crisco, or grapeseed oil). Wipe it on with a paper towel, then **wipe it off** with a clean paper towel. The layer should be so thin it looks like you removed all the oil. This is critical — too much oil creates sticky, gummy spots.
4. Place upside down in a 450-500F oven for 1 hour. (Put foil on the rack below to catch drips.)
5. Turn off the oven and let the pan cool inside.
6. Repeat 2-3 times for a solid initial seasoning.

**The key principle:** Thin layers. Always thin layers. Multiple thin layers build a smooth, hard surface. One thick layer creates a sticky mess.

## Daily Care

### After Cooking

1. **Clean while warm** — warm cast iron releases stuck food more easily than cold.
2. **Scrub with hot water** and a stiff brush or chainmail scrubber (the best tool for cast iron — $15 and lasts forever).
3. **Use soap if you want.** Modern dish soap is mild enough that it will not strip seasoning. The "no soap" rule dates from when soap contained lye, which genuinely damages seasoning. Today's Dawn or similar will not hurt your pan.
4. **Dry immediately and thoroughly.** Water is iron's enemy — it causes rust. Place on a burner over low heat for 2-3 minutes to evaporate all moisture.
5. **Apply a thin coat of oil** with a paper towel while the pan is still warm. Wipe off the excess. This prevents rust and adds a micro-layer of seasoning.

### The Routine Summarized

This takes 3 minutes. It is less work than people imagine.

## What TO Cook in Cast Iron

Cast iron excels at:

| Technique | Why Cast Iron Works |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Searing steak | Massive heat retention, even browning |
| Pan-frying | Maintains temperature when food is added |
| Cornbread | Preheated pan creates a crispy crust |
| Deep-dish pizza | Heat from the pan crisps the bottom |
| Roasting (oven) | Goes from stovetop to oven seamlessly |
| Baking (skillet cookies, cobblers) | Even heat distribution |
| Frying eggs (well-seasoned pan) | A test of your seasoning — good seasoning = eggs slide |

## What NOT to Cook in New Cast Iron

In a **newly seasoned** pan (before the seasoning is well-established):

- **Acidic foods** (tomato sauce, wine-based sauces, lemon): Acid can react with exposed iron and strip thin seasoning. Once your seasoning is thick and established (after a few months of regular use), acidic foods are less of a concern.
- **Sticky, delicate foods** (eggs, fish): Until the seasoning builds up, these will stick. Use your nonstick pan for eggs until the cast iron is ready.
- **Boiling water for extended periods:** Prolonged water contact can degrade seasoning and promote rust.

In a **well-seasoned** pan (months to years of regular use), you can cook almost anything. A properly maintained cast iron pan with thick, built-up seasoning can handle tomato sauce, deglaze with wine, and fry eggs without sticking.

## Restoring a Neglected Pan

Found a rusty, crusty cast iron pan at a yard sale or in the back of a cabinet? It is almost certainly salvageable.

### Light Rust

1. Scrub with steel wool or a chainmail scrubber until the rust is gone.
2. Wash with soap and hot water.
3. Dry completely on a burner.
4. Re-season using the oven method (2-3 rounds of thin oil coats at 450F).

### Heavy Rust or Thick, Flaking Seasoning

1. **Oven self-clean cycle:** Place the pan in the oven and run the self-clean cycle. The extreme heat (800-900F) will reduce everything — old seasoning, rust, food residue — to ash. Remove and wipe clean.
2. **Alternative: lye bath** — Soak in a solution of lye-based oven cleaner (Easy-Off Yellow Cap) in a sealed plastic bag for 24-48 hours. This dissolves old seasoning. Scrub clean.
3. **Vinegar bath for remaining rust:** 50/50 water and white vinegar for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Check frequently — vinegar can pit iron if left too long.
4. Scrub with steel wool until the bare iron is smooth and gray.
5. Re-season from scratch (3-4 rounds in the oven).

A cast iron pan is nearly indestructible. Unless it is cracked or warped, it can always be restored.

## Common Myths

| Myth | Reality |
|------|---------|
| "Never use soap" | Modern soap is fine. Lye-based soap (1950s) was the problem. |
| "Never use metal utensils" | Metal utensils are fine on cast iron. It is not nonstick coating — you cannot scratch off seasoning with a spatula. |
| "Cast iron heats evenly" | Actually, cast iron heats unevenly — it has hot spots over the burner. What it does well is retain heat. Preheat for 5+ minutes to even out. |
| "Flaxseed oil is the best for seasoning" | Flaxseed creates a hard initial seasoning but can flake over time. Crisco, avocado oil, and grapeseed oil are more reliable long-term. |
| "You should season after every single use" | A light oil wipe after drying is helpful but full oven seasoning after every use is unnecessary. Regular cooking with fat does the work. |

## Cast Iron vs. Carbon Steel

Carbon steel is cast iron's thinner, lighter cousin. Same seasoning principle, lighter weight, heats faster (but retains heat less). Preferred for wok cooking, crepes, and by cooks who find cast iron too heavy.

Both are excellent. If you can only have one, cast iron is more versatile. If you cook a lot of stir-fry or find cast iron uncomfortably heavy, add a carbon steel pan.

## The Long Game

A cast iron pan is the only piece of cookware that genuinely improves with age and use. Every time you cook bacon, sear a steak, or fry an egg, you are building the seasoning. Decades of use produce a surface that is genuinely better than new. This is cookware you pass down, not throw away. Take basic care of it and it will outlast everything else in your kitchen.
