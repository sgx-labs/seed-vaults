# Sustainable Seafood

## The Question

How do you choose seafood that tastes good, is safe to eat, and does not contribute to overfishing or environmental damage? The answer is more nuanced than "wild is good, farmed is bad" — both can be responsible or irresponsible depending on the specifics.

## The Core Principle

Not all seafood is equal in its environmental impact, and the distinction is not simply wild vs. farmed. Some wild fisheries are well-managed and sustainable. Some are overfished and destructive. Some aquaculture (fish farming) is a model of efficiency and low impact. Some is polluting and habitat-destroying.

**The question is not wild or farmed. The question is: how was this specific fish caught or raised?**

## Wild-Caught: What to Know

**Advantages:** When well-managed, wild fisheries harvest fish from natural populations that can replenish themselves. Wild fish eat their natural diet, which often results in better flavor and nutritional profiles (more omega-3s in some species).

**Risks:** Overfishing depletes populations faster than they can reproduce. Bycatch (unintended species caught alongside target species) can devastate other marine life. Some fishing methods (bottom trawling) damage ocean floor ecosystems.

**Management matters:** Well-managed fisheries have quotas, seasonal closures, and monitoring. Poorly managed fisheries have none of these. The country of origin and fishery management are more important than the "wild-caught" label alone.

## Farmed: What to Know

**Advantages:** Done well, aquaculture takes pressure off wild populations, provides consistent supply, and can be very efficient (fish convert feed to protein more efficiently than cattle or pork). Farmed shellfish (mussels, oysters, clams) actually improve water quality by filtering it.

**Risks:** Done poorly, fish farming can pollute surrounding waters with waste and antibiotics, spread disease to wild populations, and rely on wild fish for feed (using more fish than it produces). Habitat destruction (mangrove clearing for shrimp farms) is a serious concern in some regions.

**The type of farming matters:** Recirculating systems, inland farms, and shellfish farms are generally low-impact. Open-net pen farms in coastal waters carry more environmental risk.

## Generally Good Choices

These species are typically responsibly sourced, widely available, and delicious:

| Species | Source | Why It's Good | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Wild Alaska salmon | Wild (AK) | Extremely well-managed fishery, abundant | Sockeye, king, and coho are premium. Pink and chum are more affordable. |
| Farmed mussels | Farmed | Filter feeders — they clean water. No feed required. | Arguably the most sustainable protein on earth |
| Farmed oysters | Farmed | Same as mussels — filter feeders, net positive for environment | |
| Farmed clams | Farmed | Low-impact, filter feeding | |
| US farmed trout | Farmed (US) | Well-regulated, inland farms, low pollution | Rainbow trout is an excellent and affordable fish |
| US farmed catfish | Farmed (US) | Inland ponds, well-regulated | Mild flavor, versatile |
| Pacific sardines | Wild | Small, abundant, low on the food chain (lower mercury) | Packed in olive oil for best flavor. Nutritional powerhouse. |
| Atlantic mackerel | Wild | Abundant, fast-reproducing | Rich in omega-3s, strong flavor |
| Arctic char | Farmed | Typically raised in closed systems | Flavor between salmon and trout |
| Albacore tuna (US/Canada) | Wild (troll/pole) | Pole-caught is selective, low bycatch | Look for "pole-caught" or "troll-caught" |

## Generally Avoid or Choose Carefully

| Species | Concern | Alternative |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Imported shrimp (varies by country) | Mangrove destruction, poor labor practices, antibiotic use | US farmed shrimp, or wild US Gulf shrimp |
| Atlantic bluefin tuna | Severely overfished, slow to reproduce | Skipjack or albacore tuna |
| Orange roughy | Extremely long-lived (100+ years), severely depleted | Any white fish from a sustainable fishery |
| Shark | Slow-reproducing, apex predator, often finned | No direct alternative — just avoid |
| Imported king crab | Mixed management, sometimes mislabeled | US/Alaska king crab (well-managed but expensive) |
| Chilean sea bass (Patagonian toothfish) | Historically overfished, improving but still concerning | US black cod (sablefish) — similar rich texture |

## Fresh vs. Frozen Quality

A widespread misconception is that "fresh" fish is always better than frozen. In reality:

- **Most "fresh" fish at the supermarket was previously frozen.** It was frozen at sea or at the processing plant, shipped frozen, then thawed for display. You are buying thawed fish, not truly fresh.
- **Flash-frozen fish** (frozen within hours of catch) often has better quality than "fresh" fish that has been sitting on a counter for days. Freezing at -31F / -35C locks in freshness. Slow degradation over days on ice does not.
- **Truly fresh fish** (caught that day, never frozen) is available at docks, some specialty markets, and high-end fishmongers. It is the best quality but rarely available to most consumers.

**The practical approach:** Buy frozen fish confidently. It is often higher quality than the "fresh" display case. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight or in a cold water bath.

## The Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch

The most trusted consumer resource for sustainable seafood choices. Available as a free app, website, and pocket guide.

**How it works:** Rates seafood as "Best Choice," "Good Alternative," or "Avoid" based on:
- Stock health (is the population being overfished?)
- Environmental impact (habitat damage, bycatch, pollution)
- Management effectiveness (are there regulations and are they enforced?)

**Use it at the store:** Pull up the app, search for the fish you are considering, and check its rating. It accounts for the specific fishery and catch method, not just the species name.

## Mercury and Safety

Mercury accumulates in large, long-lived predatory fish. The general rule: the bigger and older the fish, the more mercury.

**Lower mercury (eat freely):** Salmon, sardines, shrimp, catfish, tilapia, pollock, trout, anchovies.

**Moderate mercury (limit to 2-3 servings/week):** Albacore tuna, halibut, mahi-mahi, snapper.

**Higher mercury (limit to 1 serving/week or less):** Swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish, bigeye tuna, shark.

For most adults, the health benefits of eating fish (omega-3 fatty acids, lean protein) outweigh the mercury risk for all but the highest-mercury species. Pregnant women and young children should follow more conservative guidelines (consult FDA/EPA joint guidance).

## The Big Picture

Eating sustainable seafood is not about perfection. It is about making informed choices where you can:
1. Favor species from well-managed fisheries or responsible farms.
2. Use Seafood Watch as a quick reference when shopping.
3. Diversify — eating a variety of sustainable species takes pressure off any single one.
4. Buy frozen confidently — it is often the best quality available.
5. Enjoy seafood. It is nutritious, delicious, and a part of healthy eating patterns worldwide.
