# Meal Prep & Batch Cooking

Meal prep has a reputation problem. Too many people imagine rows of identical plastic containers filled with dry chicken breast and steamed broccoli. That is not what this is about. Good meal prep means cooking smart so you eat well all week — prepping versatile components that mix and match, freezing things that freeze well, and transforming leftovers into something you actually look forward to eating. The goal is less daily effort, not less daily enjoyment.

## Core Principles

**Components over complete meals.** Instead of assembling seven finished dinners on Sunday, prep versatile building blocks: roasted vegetables, cooked grains, marinated proteins, a couple of sauces. Assemble different combinations through the week so you never eat the same thing twice.

**Respect what freezes well.** Soups, stews, braises, cooked beans, and sauces freeze beautifully. Crispy things, raw vegetables, cream-based sauces, and anything with high water content (lettuce, cucumbers) do not. Know the difference and you will never be disappointed by a thawed meal.

**The 2-hour rule matters.** Cooked food should not sit at room temperature for more than 2 hours (1 hour above 90 F / 32 C). Cool food quickly — spread on a sheet pan, use an ice bath for soups — before refrigerating.

**Sauces are your secret weapon.** A great sauce transforms plain grains and simple proteins into a meal worth eating. Prep two or three sauces per week: a vinaigrette, a tahini or yogurt sauce, and something punchy like chimichurri or zhug.

## Prep Day Workflow

A practical Sunday prep session (about 2 hours):

1. **Start long-cook items first** — Put a grain (rice, farro, quinoa) on the stove and a protein in the oven.
2. **Wash and chop vegetables** — While things cook, prep raw veg for snacking and cut vegetables for roasting.
3. **Roast a sheet pan of vegetables** — Toss with oil, salt, and one seasoning blend. 400 F / 200 C for 25-35 minutes.
4. **Make 2-3 sauces or dressings** — Blender or whisk, 5 minutes each.
5. **Portion and cool** — Let everything cool before packing into containers. Label with date.
6. **Freeze what you will not eat by Wednesday** — Anything you will not use in the first 3-4 days should go in the freezer, not the fridge.

## Storage Quick Reference

| Food | Fridge Life | Freezer Life | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Cooked grains | 4-5 days | 3 months | Portion before freezing, reheat with a splash of water |
| Roasted vegetables | 4-5 days | 2 months | Will soften; best used in bowls or wraps |
| Cooked chicken/pork | 3-4 days | 3 months | Slice or shred before storing for faster reheating |
| Soups and stews | 4-5 days | 4-6 months | Leave headspace in containers for expansion |
| Sauces and dressings | 5-7 days | Varies | Oil-based keep longer; dairy-based use within 5 days |
| Raw prepped vegetables | 3-5 days | N/A | Store in water (carrots, celery) or damp towel (herbs) |
