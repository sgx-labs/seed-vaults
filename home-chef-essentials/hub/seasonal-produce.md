# Seasonal Produce Guide

Cooking with what is in season is the single easiest way to improve the flavor of your food. A tomato in August and a tomato in January are barely the same ingredient. Seasonal produce is picked riper, travels shorter distances, and almost always costs less. That said, there is no shame in frozen peas, canned tomatoes, or out-of-season avocados. Frozen vegetables are often flash-frozen at peak ripeness and can be nutritionally superior to "fresh" produce that has spent two weeks in transit. Use this guide as a compass, not a rulebook.

## Key Principles

**Seasonal does not mean local-only.** Citrus in winter comes from warmer regions, and that is fine. The point is that it is at its peak — juiciest, sweetest, most abundant, and cheapest — during those months.

**Frozen and canned are legitimate options.** Canned San Marzano tomatoes are better than most fresh tomatoes 10 months of the year. Frozen spinach, peas, corn, and berries are nutritionally comparable to fresh and far more convenient. Stock your freezer without guilt.

**Farmers markets are a learning opportunity.** Even if you buy most of your produce at a grocery store, visiting a farmers market once a month teaches you what is actually in season locally. Talk to the growers — they will tell you what is at its peak and how to cook it.

**Ugly produce is often the best produce.** Heirloom tomatoes that look like they were in a fight, knobby carrots, oddly shaped squash — these are often more flavorful than their uniform grocery store counterparts.

## Seasonal Cooking Strategies

**Spring**: Light preparations — raw salads, quick blanching, simple vinaigrettes. Spring produce is tender and does not need much. Asparagus needs 3 minutes, not 10.

**Summer**: Grilling, raw preparations, and cold soups. The produce is the star. A ripe tomato needs only salt, olive oil, and maybe basil. Do less.

**Fall**: Roasting, braising, and baking. Root vegetables and squash love high heat. Apples and pears work in both sweet and savory contexts.

**Winter**: Long braises, hearty soups, and citrus brightness. Use citrus to add the freshness that winter produce sometimes lacks. Cabbage is underrated — roasted, it is extraordinary.
