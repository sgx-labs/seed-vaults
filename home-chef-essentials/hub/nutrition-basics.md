# Nutrition Basics for Home Cooks

Nutrition should help you cook better, not make you anxious. The goal here is practical literacy — understanding enough about how food fuels your body to make informed choices without obsession. There is no single "correct" diet. What works depends on your goals, preferences, activity level, health conditions, and what you actually enjoy eating. The best diet is one that provides adequate nutrition and that you will sustain long-term. This hub treats food as both fuel and pleasure, because it is both.

## Nutrition Index

| Topic | Research Note | One-Line Summary |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| Macronutrients Explained | `research/nutrition/macronutrients-explained.md` | Protein, carbohydrates, and fats — what they do, how much you need, and where to find them. |
| Building Balanced Meals | `research/nutrition/building-balanced-meals.md` | A practical framework: protein + fiber-rich carbs + healthy fat + color on every plate. |
| Reading Nutrition Labels | `research/nutrition/reading-nutrition-labels.md` | What to focus on (serving size, protein, fiber, sodium) and what to ignore (most health claims on the front). |
| Dietary Approaches Overview | `research/nutrition/dietary-approaches-overview.md` | Mediterranean, plant-forward, low-carb, and other patterns — what the evidence says, without dogma. |
| Cooking for Nutrition Retention | `research/nutrition/cooking-for-nutrition-retention.md` | How cooking methods affect vitamins and minerals. Steaming beats boiling; some nutrients increase with heat. |
| Sports Nutrition Basics | `research/nutrition/sports-nutrition-basics.md` | Fueling for activity — pre/post-workout eating, hydration, and recovery. Informed by Asker Jeukendrup's research. |
| Micronutrients and Color | `research/nutrition/micronutrients-and-color.md` | The phytonutrient spectrum and why eating a variety of colors is practical nutrition advice, not just a platitude. Informed by Deanna Minich's color-based approach. |

## Core Principles

**No diet dogma.** This vault does not advocate for any single dietary pattern. Mediterranean diets have strong evidence. Plant-forward eating has strong evidence. Some people thrive on higher-protein, lower-carb approaches. Context matters more than ideology.

**The plate method works.** The Harvard Healthy Eating Plate is one of the most practical visual guides: half the plate is vegetables and fruits, a quarter is whole grains, a quarter is protein. Add healthy fats (olive oil, nuts, avocado) and water. It is not a rigid prescription — it is a useful mental model.

**Protein is usually the lever.** Most home cooks under-eat protein relative to their needs, especially if they are active. Aim for a source of protein at every meal — this does not mean it has to be meat. Beans, lentils, eggs, dairy, tofu, and fish all count.

**Fiber matters more than most people think.** Fiber feeds your gut microbiome, improves satiety, and is associated with better outcomes across nearly every health metric. Most adults get about half the recommended 25-35g per day. Vegetables, beans, whole grains, and fruit are the easiest sources.

**Cooking is itself a nutrition intervention.** People who cook at home eat fewer calories, more vegetables, and less sodium than those who rely primarily on restaurants and packaged food. The act of cooking is already doing most of the work.

## Quick Reference: Macronutrients

| Macro | Calories/gram | Primary Role | Good Sources |
|-------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Protein | 4 | Muscle repair, satiety, enzymes | Chicken, fish, eggs, beans, lentils, tofu, dairy |
| Carbohydrate | 4 | Energy, brain fuel, fiber | Whole grains, vegetables, fruit, legumes |
| Fat | 9 | Hormone production, nutrient absorption, flavor | Olive oil, nuts, avocado, fatty fish, butter |

## The Harvard Healthy Eating Plate

A practical mental model for meal composition:

- **50% Vegetables and Fruits** — Variety and color. Potatoes do not count here (they are starchy).
- **25% Whole Grains** — Brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole wheat pasta, farro.
- **25% Healthy Protein** — Fish, poultry, beans, nuts, tofu. Limit red and processed meat.
- **Healthy Fats** — Olive oil, avocado, nuts. Use for cooking and dressing.
- **Water** — The default drink. Coffee and tea are fine. Limit sugary beverages.

## Nutrition and Cooking Methods

How you cook affects what you absorb:

- **Steaming** preserves the most water-soluble vitamins (C, B vitamins)
- **Boiling** leaches vitamins into water — use the cooking water in soups or sauces
- **Roasting** can increase availability of some antioxidants (lycopene in tomatoes)
- **Raw** is not always better — cooking breaks down cell walls, making some nutrients more bioavailable
- **Fat-soluble vitamins** (A, D, E, K) need fat present for absorption — dress your salad

## Key Voices in Practical Nutrition

- **Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health** — The Healthy Eating Plate, evidence-based and independent of food industry influence
- **Deanna Minich, PhD** — Phytonutrient spectrum and color-based eating approach. Her work connects the colors on your plate to specific nutrient families and health benefits
- **Asker Jeukendrup, PhD** — Sports nutrition researcher whose work on carbohydrate periodization and exercise fueling is practical for active home cooks
- **Registered Dietitians (RDs)** — For personalized nutrition advice, RDs are the credentialed professionals. Beware of "nutritionist" (unregulated in most states)
