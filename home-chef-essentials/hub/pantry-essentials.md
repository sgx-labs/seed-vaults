# Pantry Essentials

A well-stocked pantry is the difference between "there is nothing to eat" and a good meal from whatever is on hand. You do not need to buy everything at once — build over time, replacing items as you use them. The goal is a reliable base of shelf-stable ingredients that let you cook a wide variety of meals without a dedicated grocery run. Think of your pantry as infrastructure: the roads and bridges that make all the other cooking possible.

## Pantry Categories

### Oils and Fats

| Item | Use | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Extra-virgin olive oil | Dressings, finishing, medium-heat cooking | Buy the best you can afford for finishing; a cheaper one for cooking |
| Neutral oil (avocado or grapeseed) | High-heat searing, frying, stir-fry | Avocado oil has a higher smoke point than most; canola works too |
| Unsalted butter | Sauces, baking, finishing | Keep in fridge; freeze extra sticks |
| Toasted sesame oil | Asian dishes, finishing | A little goes a long way; store in fridge after opening |

### Vinegars and Acids

| Item | Use | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Red wine vinegar | Vinaigrettes, marinades, pan sauces | Workhorse acid for European flavors |
| Rice vinegar | Asian dressings, sushi rice, pickling | Milder than most vinegars; unseasoned preferred |
| Apple cider vinegar | Dressings, brines, baking | Versatile; good for buttermilk substitute (1 tbsp per cup of milk) |
| Lemons and limes | Finishing, dressings, marinades | Not shelf-stable, but buy them every trip — acid transforms dishes |

### Spices (Whole and Ground)

**Whole spices** last 2-3 years; **ground spices** lose potency after 6-12 months. Buy small quantities of ground spices and replace them when they stop smelling like anything.

| Essential Spices | Notes |
|-----------------|-------|
| Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal) | The default cooking salt; flaky, easy to pinch, less salty by volume than Morton's |
| Black peppercorns | Buy whole, grind fresh. Pre-ground pepper is a shadow of the real thing |
| Cumin (whole and ground) | Earthy, warm — essential for Mexican, Indian, Middle Eastern cooking |
| Smoked paprika | Depth and color without heat; Spanish pimenton is the gold standard |
| Red pepper flakes | Adjustable heat; toast in oil to bloom flavor |
| Dried oregano | Mediterranean and Mexican staple |
| Ground cinnamon | Sweet and savory — not just for baking |
| Garlic powder | When fresh garlic would burn (dry rubs, quick marinades) |
| Ground turmeric | Color and mild earthiness; pair with black pepper for absorption |
| Bay leaves | Subtle depth in braises, soups, beans. Remove before serving |

### Canned Goods

| Item | Use |
|------|-----|
| Whole peeled tomatoes (San Marzano style) | Sauces, soups, braises — crush by hand for the best texture |
| Chickpeas | Salads, curries, hummus, roasted snacks |
| Black beans | Tacos, soups, rice bowls, burgers |
| Coconut milk (full-fat) | Curries, soups, smoothies, rice |
| Tomato paste | Concentrated umami; saute in oil before adding liquid |

### Dried Goods

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Long-grain rice (jasmine or basmati) | Fluffy, aromatic, pairs with almost everything |
| Short-grain rice | Sushi, risotto, rice bowls — starchier, stickier |
| Dried pasta (2-3 shapes) | Spaghetti for long sauces, penne/rigatoni for chunky sauces, orzo for soups |
| Dried lentils (green or French) | Cook in 25 minutes, no soaking. Salads, soups, side dishes |
| Dried beans (black, pinto, or cannellini) | Soak overnight or quick-soak. Better texture and flavor than canned |
| Rolled oats | Breakfast, baking, meatball binder |
| All-purpose flour | Roux, dredging, baking, thickening |

### Condiments and Sauces

| Item | Use |
|------|-----|
| Soy sauce (or tamari) | Umami backbone for Asian dishes, marinades, and surprisingly good in non-Asian cooking |
| Fish sauce | Umami depth; use sparingly. Essential for Thai, Vietnamese |
| Dijon mustard | Vinaigrettes, marinades, pan sauces, sandwiches |
| Hot sauce (your preference) | Heat and acid; keep 2-3 varieties |
| Honey | Glazes, dressings, baking, tea |
| Tahini | Dressings, sauces, hummus, drizzling |

### Baking Staples

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| All-purpose flour | Already listed above; the universal baking flour |
| Granulated sugar | Sweetening, caramelization, baking structure |
| Brown sugar (light) | Molasses flavor, moisture in baked goods |
| Baking soda | Chemical leavener; needs acid to activate |
| Baking powder | Double-acting leavener; works on its own |
| Pure vanilla extract | Real extract, not imitation. Used in nearly all baking |
| Active dry yeast | Bread, pizza dough, rolls. Store in fridge or freezer |

## Pantry Maintenance

**Rotate stock.** Move older items to the front when you add new ones. Check expiration dates quarterly.

**Smell your spices.** If a ground spice does not smell like anything when you open the jar, it will not taste like anything in your food. Replace it.

**Buy whole spices when you can.** A $10 spice grinder (or a dedicated coffee grinder) and whole cumin, coriander, and peppercorns will transform your cooking.

**Store properly.** Cool, dark, dry. Flour and whole grains can go in the freezer if you do not use them quickly. Oils go rancid in heat and light.
