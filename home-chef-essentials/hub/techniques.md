# Core Cooking Techniques

Good cooking is applied science. Every technique in the kitchen — searing a steak, emulsifying a vinaigrette, braising a short rib — relies on physical and chemical principles that, once understood, make you a better cook in every context. This hub indexes the technique research notes in this vault. The goal is not to memorize rules but to understand mechanisms so you can adapt, troubleshoot, and improvise with confidence.

## Technique Index

| Technique | Research Note | One-Line Summary |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| Heat Transfer | `research/techniques/science-of-heat-transfer.md` | Conduction, convection, and radiation — how energy moves into food and why it matters for every cooking method. |
| Maillard Reaction & Browning | `research/techniques/maillard-reaction-and-browning.md` | The chemistry behind flavor development on seared, roasted, and baked surfaces. Requires dry surface + high heat. |
| Emulsions & Sauces | `research/techniques/emulsions-and-sauces.md` | How to combine oil and water into stable sauces — vinaigrettes, pan sauces, hollandaise, and why they break. |
| Braising & Slow Cooking | `research/techniques/braising-and-slow-cooking.md` | Collagen-to-gelatin conversion in tough cuts. Low temperature + time + moisture = fork-tender results. |
| Knife Skills | `research/techniques/knife-skills.md` | Core cuts (dice, julienne, chiffonade, brunoise), knife selection, sharpening, and why consistent cuts mean even cooking. |
| Fermentation Basics | `research/techniques/fermentation-basics.md` | Lacto-fermentation, yeast fermentation, and controlled decomposition — pickles, bread, yogurt, and beyond. |
| Baking Science | `research/techniques/baking-science.md` | Flour, gluten, leavening, hydration, and oven dynamics. Why baking is more precise than stovetop cooking. |
| Sous Vide | `research/techniques/sous-vide-fundamentals.md` | Precision temperature cooking in vacuum-sealed bags. Edge-to-edge doneness and the time-temperature relationship. |
| Wok Cooking | `research/techniques/wok-cooking.md` | Wok hei, high-heat technique, oil management, and the stir-fry sequence. Adapted for home burners. |
| Stocks & Broths | `research/techniques/stocks-and-broths.md` | Extracting flavor and body from bones, aromatics, and time. The foundation of soups, sauces, and braises. |
| Salt Fat Acid Heat Framework | `research/techniques/salt-fat-acid-heat-framework.md` | Samin Nosrat's four-element approach to understanding and fixing any dish. |

## Key Concepts

**Heat is not monolithic.** A cast iron skillet (conduction), a convection oven (moving air), and a grill (radiant heat) all cook food differently even at the same temperature. Understanding which heat source to use and why is foundational.

**Dry surfaces brown; wet surfaces steam.** The Maillard reaction begins around 280-330 F (140-165 C). If moisture is present on the surface, energy goes to evaporation instead of browning. Pat dry, preheat the pan, and do not crowd.

**Collagen breaks down with time, not force.** Braising works because collagen in connective tissue converts to gelatin between 160-180 F (71-82 C) over hours. Rushing raises the temperature and dries out the meat.

**Temperature control is the most impactful variable.** Whether you are searing, braising, baking, or cooking sous vide, precise temperature management separates good results from great ones.
