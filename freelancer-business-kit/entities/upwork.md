# Upwork — Freelance Platform

## What It Is

The largest freelancing platform, connecting freelancers with clients for project-based and ongoing work. Useful for finding initial clients, building a track record, and supplementing direct client work. Not a long-term pricing strategy — the goal is to graduate to direct relationships.

## Why Freelancers Use It

- Access to a large pool of clients actively looking for help
- Built-in payment protection (escrow for fixed-price, weekly for hourly)
- Reviews and ratings build social proof
- Good for building a portfolio when starting out
- Connects system handles contracts and dispute resolution

## Pricing (Current)

| Revenue with Client | Fee |
|---------------------|-----|
| First $500 | 20% |
| $500.01 – $10,000 | 10% |
| Over $10,000 | 5% |

Connects (required to send proposals): 16 free per month, additional at $0.15 each.

## Profile Optimization

1. **Professional headshot** — Profiles with photos get significantly more views
2. **Specific title** — "Senior React Developer" beats "Web Developer"
3. **Results-focused overview** — Lead with outcomes, not credentials
4. **Portfolio pieces** — 3-6 examples of your best work with context
5. **Skills tags** — Use all available slots with relevant, specific skills
6. **Availability badge** — Keep it current so clients know you can start

## Proposal Strategy

- **Read the entire job post.** Reference specific details to prove you read it.
- **Lead with a relevant result.** "I built a similar dashboard that reduced report time by 40%."
- **Be specific about your approach.** "Here is how I would tackle this in 3 phases."
- **Ask one smart question.** Shows engagement and filters out mass-bidders.
- **Keep it under 200 words.** Clients read dozens of proposals.

## Tips

- Only bid on jobs where you are a strong fit — quality over quantity
- Respond to invitations within 24 hours
- Over-deliver on first projects to build your rating
- Once you hit Top Rated, use it as social proof everywhere
- Transition long-term Upwork clients to direct relationships when appropriate

## The Graduation Strategy

Upwork is a stepping stone, not a destination:

1. Build a 5-star profile with 10+ reviews
2. Identify clients who need ongoing work
3. Propose a direct relationship (lower rate for them, higher net for you)
4. Use your Upwork reviews as portfolio proof for direct clients

## Alternatives

- **Toptal** — Higher-end, strict screening, better rates
- **Contra** — Commission-free, growing platform
- **Fiverr** — Productized service listings, different model
