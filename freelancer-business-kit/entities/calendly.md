# Calendly — Scheduling

## What It Is

Scheduling automation tool that lets clients book time with you without the back-and-forth emails. You set your availability, share a link, and clients pick a slot. Eliminates the "when are you free?" dance.

## Why Freelancers Use It

- Eliminates scheduling back-and-forth (saves 30+ minutes per meeting)
- Professional booking experience for clients
- Buffer time between meetings (prevents back-to-back burnout)
- Time zone handling (critical for remote/international clients)
- Calendar sync prevents double-booking

## Pricing (Current)

| Plan | Monthly | Features |
|------|---------|----------|
| Free | $0 | 1 event type, basic integrations |
| Standard | $12/mo | Unlimited event types, reminders, integrations |
| Teams | $20/mo | Round-robin, collective scheduling |

The free plan is sufficient for most solo freelancers starting out.

## Setup for Freelancers

1. Sign up at calendly.com
2. Connect your calendar (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.)
3. Set your general availability hours
4. Create event types for different meeting purposes
5. Add buffer time between meetings (minimum 15 minutes)
6. Share your booking link in your email signature and proposals

## Recommended Event Types

| Event | Duration | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Discovery Call | 30 min | Initial client conversation |
| Project Check-in | 15 min | Quick status updates |
| Working Session | 60 min | Collaborative work or deep review |
| Consultation | 45 min | Paid consultation or strategy session |

## Key Settings

- **Buffer time:** 15 minutes before and after meetings
- **Minimum notice:** 24 hours (prevents same-day surprises)
- **Daily limit:** Cap at 3-4 meetings per day to protect deep work time
- **Availability:** Block off focused work time — not every hour needs to be bookable
- **Reminders:** Auto-send 24 hours and 1 hour before

## Tips

- Put your Calendly link in your email signature
- Use different event types for discovery calls vs. project check-ins
- Block off Monday mornings and Friday afternoons for deep work
- For paid consultations, connect Stripe to collect payment at booking
- Set "secret" event types for VIP clients with priority scheduling
