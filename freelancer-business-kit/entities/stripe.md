# Stripe — Payment Processing

## What It Is

Online payment processing platform. Accepts credit cards, ACH bank transfers, and international payments. The most common payment processor for freelancers who invoice directly (not through a platform like Upwork).

## Why Freelancers Use It

- Accept credit card payments on invoices
- ACH transfers for lower fees on large payments
- International payments in 135+ currencies
- Integrates with FreshBooks, QuickBooks, and most invoicing tools
- Professional payment links you can embed in invoices

## Pricing (Current)

| Method | Fee |
|--------|-----|
| Credit/debit card | 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction |
| ACH bank transfer | 0.8%, capped at $5.00 |
| International cards | +1.5% on top of standard rate |
| Instant payout | 1% of payout amount (min $0.50) |

## Setup for Freelancers

1. Create a Stripe account at stripe.com
2. Complete identity verification (takes 1-2 business days)
3. Connect your bank account for payouts
4. Set up payment links or integrate with your invoicing tool
5. Standard payouts arrive in 2 business days

## Key Settings

- Enable two-factor authentication on your account
- Download monthly statements for your accountant
