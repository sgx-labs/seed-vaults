# Decision Log

## BD-001: Use written contracts for every project

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-14

Every project, regardless of size or relationship, gets a written contract before work begins. Verbal agreements are unenforceable and lead to disputes. Even a simple one-page agreement is better than nothing. Templates are in `templates/contract-template.md`.

**Alternative considered:** Informal agreements for small projects or repeat clients. Rejected because the projects that seem "too small to bother" are exactly the ones that go sideways.

## BD-002: Net 15 payment terms as default

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-14

Default payment terms are Net 15 (due within 15 days of invoice). Clients who insist on Net 30 must agree to a deposit structure (50% upfront). Net 45 or Net 60 is never acceptable for a freelancer's cash flow.

**Alternative considered:** Net 30 as default. Rejected because it extends cash flow gaps unnecessarily. Enterprise clients who require Net 30 can negotiate, but it should not be the starting position.

## BD-003: Milestone payments for projects over $5,000

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-14

Any project exceeding $5,000 uses milestone-based payment. At minimum: 30-50% upfront, remainder at defined checkpoints. Never deliver final work before final payment. This protects cash flow and reduces risk for both parties.

**Alternative considered:** 100% on delivery. Rejected because it creates too much risk for the freelancer and incentivizes scope expansion by the client.

## BD-004: 1.5% monthly late fee in all contracts

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-14

All contracts include a 1.5% monthly late fee (18% annually). This is within legal limits in most US jurisdictions and serves as both a deterrent and compensation for delayed payment. Late fees should be enforced consistently.

**Alternative considered:** No late fees, relying on relationship pressure. Rejected because it signals that late payment has no consequences.

## BD-005: IP transfers only on final payment

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-14

All intellectual property rights remain with the freelancer until the final payment is received in full. Work product is licensed for client review during the project but ownership does not transfer until the financial obligation is complete.

**Alternative considered:** IP transfers on delivery. Rejected because it removes the primary leverage for ensuring payment.

## BD-006: Limit revision rounds in every SOW

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-14

Every scope of work includes a defined number of revision rounds (typically 2-3). Additional revisions beyond the included rounds are billed at the hourly rate. This prevents infinite feedback loops and makes the cost of indecision visible.

**Alternative considered:** Unlimited revisions. Rejected because it leads to scope creep and undervalues the freelancer's time.
