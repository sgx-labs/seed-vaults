# How to Fire a Client Professionally

## The Core Idea

Sometimes the best business decision is ending a client relationship. A bad client drains time, energy, and morale that could be spent on better work. Firing a client is not failure — it is portfolio curation. The key is doing it professionally, firmly, and without burning bridges.

## When to Fire a Client

### Clear Signals

- **Repeated late payments** — Two or more late payments after reminders
- **Consistent scope creep** — Expanding requirements without budget adjustments
- **Disrespectful behavior** — Belittling your work, personal attacks, unreasonable demands
- **Chronic unavailability** — Goes dark for weeks, then demands urgent turnaround
- **Makes you dread checking your inbox** — The emotional toll exceeds the financial benefit

### Do the Math First

Before firing a client, calculate:
- What percentage of your revenue do they represent?
- Do you have enough pipeline to replace the income?
- Are there any contractual obligations you need to fulfill?
- What is the cost (time, stress, opportunity) of keeping them?

## How to Do It

### Step 1: Review Your Contract

Check your termination clause. Most contracts require 14-30 days written notice. Honor the terms. Deliver any work in progress to the current milestone.

### Step 2: Choose Your Approach

**The Business Shift (softest):**
"My business is evolving and I am narrowing my focus to [specific niche]. Unfortunately, that means I will not be able to continue our engagement after [date]. I want to make sure you have time to find a replacement."

**The Capacity Redirect:**
"Due to some changes in my workload and commitments, I will not have the capacity to continue our work together beyond [date]. I want to give you enough notice to find someone who can give your project the attention it deserves."

**The Direct (for serious issues):**
"I have given this careful thought and I believe it is best for both of us to wrap up our working relationship. I will complete [current deliverables] by [date] and help with a smooth transition."

### Step 3: Put It in Writing

Even if you discuss it on a call, follow up with a written email that includes:
- The end date
- What you will deliver before then
- Any outstanding invoices
- Transition details

### Step 4: Complete Your Obligations

Finish any work you have been paid for or that is contractually required. Do not leave mid-deliverable if you can avoid it. Your professional reputation is worth more than the satisfaction of walking away immediately.

### Step 5: Send a Final Invoice

Invoice for all outstanding work. Include any final deliverables. The IP transfer clause in your contract ensures they do not get the work until they pay.

## What NOT to Do

- **Do not ghost.** Disappearing is unprofessional and damages your reputation.
- **Do not blame.** Keep it about business direction, not personal grievances.
- **Do not badmouth.** The freelance world is small. They will hear about it.
- **Do not negotiate if your mind is made up.** If they offer more money, remember why you wanted out.
- **Do not feel guilty.** This is a business decision. They will find another freelancer.

## After the Breakup

1. Document what happened (for your own learning)
2. Update your red flags list with any new patterns you noticed
3. Reach out to your pipeline — fill the gap before it becomes a crisis
4. Take a moment to appreciate having one less source of stress
5. Log the decision in `decisions/log.md`

## Sample Email Template
