# Client Communication — Practices That Build Trust

## The Core Idea

Most freelancer-client problems are communication problems. Not skill problems, not pricing problems — communication. The freelancers who keep clients longest and get the best referrals are not necessarily the most talented. They are the most communicative. Clients equate communication with professionalism.

## The Communication Stack

### Proactive Updates

Do not wait for clients to ask "how is it going?" Send regular updates before they ask. A weekly status email takes 10 minutes and prevents hours of anxiety-driven check-ins.

**Weekly status email template:**

"Hi [Client],

Here is your weekly update on [project]:

**Completed this week:**
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

**In progress:**
- [Item 3] — expected completion [date]

**Needs your input:**
- [Item 4] — please [specific action] by [date]

**Next week:**
- [Planned work]

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
[Your Name]"

### Response Time Standards

| Priority | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| Urgent | Same day (within 4 hours) | Blocking issue, system down |
| Normal | Within 1 business day | Questions, feedback, requests |
| Low | Within 2-3 business days | FYI items, non-urgent updates |

Set these expectations during onboarding and meet them consistently. Over-delivering on response time builds trust faster than almost anything else.

### Meeting Discipline

- Every meeting has an agenda (shared in advance)
- Every meeting has a time limit (30 minutes default)
- Every meeting produces action items (sent as follow-up within 24 hours)
- Recurring check-ins happen at the same time each week
- Camera on for client calls (builds rapport)

## Communication Principles

### Be the First to Share Bad News

If something is going wrong — a deadline at risk, a technical challenge, a cost overrun — communicate it immediately. Clients can handle bad news. They cannot handle surprises.

"I wanted to flag a potential issue with [X]. I've identified [problem] and I'm working on [solution]. This may impact the timeline by [X days]. I'll update you by [date] with a definitive answer."

### Explain Decisions, Not Just Deliverables

When you submit work, include a brief explanation of your key decisions. This reduces revision requests driven by misunderstanding and positions you as a thoughtful professional, not a task executor.

### Summarize Every Call in Writing

After any phone or video call, send a brief recap email:

"Hi [Client], great call today. Here is a summary of what we discussed:

1. [Decision made]
2. [Action item — owner — deadline]
3. [Next steps]

Please let me know if I missed anything."

This creates a paper trail and prevents "I thought we agreed to..." disputes later.

### Say "I Don't Know" When You Don't Know

Guessing or hand-waving erodes trust. "I am not sure about that. Let me research it and get back to you by [date]" is always better than a vague answer.

## Difficult Conversations

### Delivering a Scope Change Notice

"I want to make sure we stay aligned on this project. The request for [X] is outside our current scope. I can absolutely do it — it would take approximately [hours] and add $[amount] to the project. Want me to put together a quick change order?"

### Pushing Back on an Unreasonable Timeline

"I want to deliver the best possible result for you. To do that at the quality level you expect, I need [X] more days. If we rush it, we risk [specific quality issue]. Can we adjust the deadline to [new date]?"

### Addressing a Payment Issue

"I noticed that invoice [number] is [X] days past due. I want to make sure there is no issue on my end. Can you check the status?"

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Going dark** — Disappearing for days without communication is the fastest way to lose trust.
2. **Over-promising** — "I will have it done by Friday" when you know you cannot. Under-promise, over-deliver.
3. **Being defensive about feedback** — "Thank you for the feedback. Let me review it and I will respond with a plan by [date]."
4. **Sending novels** — Keep emails concise. Use bullet points. Respect the client's time.
5. **Only communicating when you need something** — Build the relationship, not just the transaction.
