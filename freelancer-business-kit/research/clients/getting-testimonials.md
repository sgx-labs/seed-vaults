# Getting Testimonials and Case Studies

## The Core Idea

Social proof sells. A testimonial from a real client is more persuasive than any self-written marketing copy. Case studies demonstrate results. The best time to ask is when the client is happiest — right after a successful delivery. Make it easy for them and you will get better responses.

## When to Ask

### The Golden Moment

Ask within 48 hours of a successful project delivery or milestone. The client is happy, the results are fresh, and goodwill is at its peak. Waiting weeks or months makes it harder for them to remember specifics and easier for them to forget.

### Other Good Moments

- After they share positive feedback unprompted
- When they refer you to someone else (they clearly value your work)
- At the end of a retainer renewal
- After hitting a measurable business result

## How to Ask

### Make It Easy

Most clients want to help but don't know what to say. Give them a framework:

**The Direct Ask:**
"I am building out my portfolio and your project turned out great. Would you be willing to share a quick testimonial? I can send you a few prompts to make it easy."

**The Prompted Approach:**
Send 3-4 specific questions:
1. What problem were you trying to solve when you hired me?
2. What was the result of our work together?
3. What surprised you about working with me?
4. Would you recommend me to others? Why?

**The Draft-and-Approve:**
Write a testimonial based on what they have told you and ask them to approve or edit it. This has the highest completion rate because it requires minimal effort from the client.

### Where to Ask

- Email (most professional, easiest to reference later)
- LinkedIn recommendation (public, searchable, credible)
- Google Business review (if you have a business listing)
- Clutch or industry-specific directories

## Building Case Studies

### Case Study Structure

1. **The Challenge** — What problem the client faced (2-3 sentences)
2. **The Approach** — What you did and why (3-5 sentences)
3. **The Result** — Measurable outcomes (numbers are gold)
4. **Client Quote** — Direct testimonial embedded in the story

### Getting Permission

Always get written permission before publishing a case study. Some clients prefer anonymity — offer options:
- Full attribution (company name, client name, logo)
- Partial ("A fintech startup" instead of company name)
- NDA-compliant summary (describe the work without naming the client)

### Making Results Measurable

Help clients articulate the impact:
- "Revenue increased by X%"
- "Time to complete [process] decreased from X hours to Y hours"
- "Customer support tickets reduced by X%"
- "Launched X weeks ahead of schedule"

If you do not have hard numbers, use qualitative results: "The team now spends zero time on manual data entry" or "The new system handles 3x the previous load."

## Using Testimonials Effectively

1. **Website** — Dedicated testimonials page plus scattered throughout relevant pages
2. **Proposals** — Include 1-2 relevant testimonials near the pricing section
3. **Social media** — Share case studies as content (with client permission)
4. **Email signature** — Rotate a short testimonial quote
5. **Platform profiles** — Upwork, LinkedIn, Contra — keep them current

## Tips

- Aim for one new testimonial per quarter at minimum
- Video testimonials are more powerful than text (even a 30-second phone recording)
- Testimonials that mention specific results outperform generic praise
- Keep a running file of positive client feedback — it is testimonial material waiting to be formalized
- Thank clients for testimonials — a handwritten note goes a long way
