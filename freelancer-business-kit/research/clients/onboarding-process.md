# Client Onboarding — Setting the Relationship Up for Success

## The Core Idea

How you start a client relationship determines how it goes. A professional onboarding process sets expectations, establishes communication norms, and prevents the most common problems before they start. Invest an hour in onboarding and save ten hours of conflict resolution later.

## The Onboarding Checklist

### 1. Discovery Call (Before Proposal)

- Understand the problem they are trying to solve (not just the deliverable they want)
- Ask about budget range, timeline, and decision-making process
- Identify who the decision-maker is (avoid design-by-committee)
- Ask about past experience with freelancers
- Note communication preferences (email, Slack, calls)

### 2. Proposal and Negotiation

- Send proposal within 48 hours of discovery call
- Include scope, timeline, deliverables, price, and exclusions
- Allow 3-5 business days for review
- Schedule a call to walk through the proposal if it is over $5,000

### 3. Contract Signing

- Send contract and SOW together
- Use e-signature (DocuSign, HelloSign, or even a simple PDF sign)
- Collect deposit before starting work
- File the signed contract where you can find it

### 4. Kickoff

- Schedule a kickoff call (separate from discovery)
- Confirm deliverables, timeline, and communication cadence
- Get access to all necessary systems, files, and resources
- Establish feedback and approval process
- Agree on check-in frequency (weekly is standard)
- Document all agreements in a follow-up email

### 5. Communication Setup

- Add client to your project management tool (if using one)
- Set up a shared folder for deliverables
- Exchange emergency contact information
- Clarify response time expectations (e.g., 24 hours for email, 4 hours for Slack)

## Setting Expectations That Stick

### Working Hours

"I am available Monday through Friday, 9am-5pm [timezone]. Messages received outside those hours will be addressed the next business day."

### Communication Cadence

"I will send a weekly status update every [day]. If you need to reach me urgently between updates, [email/Slack/text] is the best channel."

### Feedback and Approvals

"I will submit deliverables for your review at each milestone. Please provide consolidated feedback within [X] business days. Delays in feedback will shift the project timeline accordingly."

### What Happens When Things Change

"If the scope needs to change, I will send a change order with the additional cost and timeline impact before starting any new work."

## Common Onboarding Mistakes

1. **Skipping the kickoff call.** Starting work without alignment leads to rework.
2. **Not confirming the decision-maker.** Getting feedback from three people with conflicting opinions wastes time.
3. **Assuming communication norms.** Explicitly define how, when, and how often you communicate.
4. **Not getting all access upfront.** Chasing credentials mid-project kills momentum.
5. **Being too casual about the contract.** Friendliness is great. Informality in business terms is dangerous.
