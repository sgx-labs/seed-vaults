# Managing Multiple Projects Without Dropping Balls

## The Core Idea

Most freelancers juggle 2-5 active projects at any time. The ones who succeed have systems. The ones who fail rely on memory. Your brain is for creative work, not tracking deadlines. Offload project management to tools and routines.

## The System

### 1. Single Source of Truth

Pick one tool and put everything in it. Not some tasks in email, some in notes, and some in your head.

**Options by complexity:**
- **Minimal:** A text file or note per project with tasks, deadlines, and next actions
- **Moderate:** Trello, Notion, or Todoist with a board per project
- **Full:** Asana, Linear, or ClickUp for multi-project dashboards

The best tool is the one you actually use every day.

### 2. Weekly Planning Ritual

Every Monday morning (or Friday afternoon), review all active projects:
- What is due this week?
- What is blocked and needs client action?
- What can I batch together?
- Which project needs the most focus this week?

Block time for each project on your calendar. If it is not on the calendar, it will not happen.

### 3. Daily Prioritization

Each morning, identify the top 3 tasks across all projects. Do those first. Everything else is secondary.

- **One big task** — The deliverable that moves a project forward
- **One small task** — A quick win that clears mental overhead
- **One communication task** — A follow-up, status update, or request

### 4. Time Blocking

Assign specific days or time blocks to specific projects. Context switching is expensive. A day focused on one project is more productive than an hour on each of five projects.

**Example schedule:**
- Monday/Tuesday: Client A (major project)
- Wednesday: Client B (retainer work)
- Thursday: Client C (smaller project) + admin
- Friday: Pipeline work, proposals, business development

### 5. Communication Cadence

Set predictable update schedules for each client:
- Weekly status emails (same day each week)
- Milestone notifications when deliverables are ready
- Immediate escalation for blockers that need client input

Clients who know when to expect updates stop sending "just checking in" messages.

## Common Failure Modes

### Over-Committing

You have 40 productive hours per week (at best). Subtract time for admin, sales, and communication. You probably have 25-30 hours of actual deliverable work per week. Plan accordingly.

### Ignoring the Least Urgent Project

The project with the furthest deadline always feels like it can wait. Until it cannot. Touch every active project at least once per week.

### Not Tracking Time

Even if you bill project-based, track your hours. It reveals which projects are profitable and which are eating your margins. It also informs future estimates.

### Letting Admin Pile Up

Invoicing, contracts, expense tracking — batch these on a specific day. Letting admin pile up creates anxiety and cash flow problems.

## When You Have Too Many Projects

Signs of overload:
- Missing deadlines
- Quality dropping
- Working nights and weekends regularly
- Dreading the start of each day

Solutions:
1. Stop accepting new work until current projects clear
2. Extend timelines with the most flexible client
3. Subcontract specific tasks (with client permission)
4. Raise your rates — fewer clients at higher rates = same revenue, less work

## Tools That Help

- **Time tracking:** Toggl, Harvest, Clockify
- **Project management:** Trello, Notion, Linear, Asana
- **Calendar blocking:** Google Calendar, Fantastical
- **Invoicing:** FreshBooks, Wave (see `entities/freshbooks.md`)
- **Scheduling:** Calendly (see `entities/calendly.md`)
