# LLC vs S-Corp vs Sole Proprietorship — Choosing Your Business Entity

## The Core Idea

Your business entity structure determines your liability protection and how you are taxed. Most freelancers start as sole proprietors, form an LLC when they want liability protection, and elect S-Corp tax treatment when their income justifies the additional complexity. The right choice depends on your income level, risk tolerance, and willingness to deal with paperwork.

## The Three Options

### Sole Proprietorship

**What it is:** The default. If you freelance without forming a separate entity, you are a sole proprietor.

**How you are taxed:** All business income flows to your personal return (Schedule C). You pay income tax plus self-employment tax (15.3%) on all net profit.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Zero setup cost | No liability protection |
| Simplest tax filing | Less professional appearance |
| No annual state filings | Personal assets at risk |
| Complete control | Harder to get business credit |

**Best for:** Freelancers just starting out with low revenue and low risk.

### Single-Member LLC

**What it is:** A separate legal entity that protects your personal assets from business liabilities.

**How you are taxed:** By default, exactly the same as a sole proprietorship (Schedule C). The LLC is a "disregarded entity" for tax purposes. You still pay self-employment tax on all net profit.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Liability protection | Filing fees ($50-$500 depending on state) |
| Professional credibility | Annual state fees (some states) |
| Separate legal entity | Slightly more paperwork |
| Can elect S-Corp tax later | Operating agreement recommended |

**Best for:** Most freelancers once they have consistent income. The liability protection alone is worth it.

### LLC with S-Corp Tax Election

**What it is:** An LLC that has elected to be taxed as an S-Corporation. The legal structure is still an LLC. Only the tax treatment changes.

**How you are taxed:** You pay yourself a "reasonable salary" and take the rest as distributions. The salary portion is subject to payroll taxes (equivalent to self-employment tax). Distributions are not subject to self-employment tax.

**Example at $120,000 net income:**

| | Without S-Corp | With S-Corp |
|--|---------------|-------------|
| Salary | N/A | $70,000 |
| Distributions | N/A | $50,000 |
| SE tax base | $120,000 | $70,000 (salary only) |
| SE/payroll tax | ~$16,956 | ~$10,710 |
| **Tax savings** | — | **~$6,246/year** |

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Significant tax savings at higher income | Must run payroll (cost: $500-$2,000/year) |
| Same liability protection as LLC | Additional tax filing (Form 1120-S) |
| Distributions not subject to SE tax | "Reasonable salary" must be justified |
| | Higher accounting costs |
| | Earlier tax deadline (March 15) |

**Best for:** Freelancers with net income consistently above $50,000-$60,000 per year.

## The Decision Framework

### Under $40,000 Net Income

Stay as a sole proprietor or basic LLC. The tax savings from S-Corp do not justify the additional cost and complexity.

### $40,000 - $60,000 Net Income

Form an LLC if you have not already. Start talking to a CPA about whether S-Corp election makes sense. It is borderline at this level.

### Over $60,000 Net Income

Strongly consider S-Corp election. At $100,000 net income, you are likely saving $5,000-$8,000 per year in self-employment tax. That more than covers the additional accounting and payroll costs.

### Over $150,000 Net Income

S-Corp election is almost certainly beneficial. Consult a CPA to optimize your salary/distribution split.

## How to Make the Change

### Forming an LLC

1. Choose a state (usually your home state)
2. File Articles of Organization with the state
3. Get an EIN from the IRS (free, takes 5 minutes online)
4. Draft an operating agreement
5. Open a business bank account
6. Update client contracts to your LLC name

### Electing S-Corp Tax Treatment

1. File Form 2553 with the IRS (due by March 15 of the tax year you want it to take effect)
2. Set up payroll (use Gusto, QuickBooks Payroll, or similar)
3. Pay yourself a reasonable salary
4. File Form 1120-S annually by March 15
5. Issue yourself a W-2

### What Is a "Reasonable Salary"?

The IRS requires that S-Corp owners pay themselves a salary that is "reasonable" for the work they do. You cannot pay yourself $10,000 and take $190,000 as distributions. Research market rates for your role and use that as a benchmark. Your CPA can help determine the right amount.

## Important Notes

- This is general guidance, not tax or legal advice
- State laws and fees vary significantly
- Consult a CPA and/or attorney for your specific situation
- Some states (California, for example) charge an annual LLC fee of $800 regardless of income
- Entity structure can be changed, so do not over-analyze — start with something and adjust as you grow
