# Retirement Planning for Freelancers

## The Core Idea

No employer is matching your 401(k). No one is automatically enrolling you in a retirement plan. As a freelancer, retirement savings is entirely your responsibility. The good news: you have access to retirement accounts with higher contribution limits than most employees, and every dollar you contribute reduces your taxable income.

## Retirement Account Options

### SEP-IRA (Simplified Employee Pension)

**Best for:** Freelancers who want simplicity.

- Contribute up to 25% of net self-employment income
- Maximum contribution: ~$69,000 (2024, adjusted annually)
- No employee contribution — all employer contributions
- Easy to set up (most brokerages, takes 15 minutes)
- No annual filing requirements
- Can open and fund for the prior year up to the tax filing deadline

**Downside:** Contribution is limited to 25% of net income. At $100,000 net, maximum is ~$20,500 (after the self-employment tax deduction calculation).

### Solo 401(k)

**Best for:** Freelancers who want to maximize contributions.

- Employee contribution: Up to $23,000 (2024, adjusted annually) + $7,500 catch-up if 50+
- Employer contribution: Up to 25% of net self-employment income
- Combined maximum: ~$69,000 (2024) or ~$76,500 with catch-up
- Higher total contributions possible at lower income levels than SEP-IRA
- Roth option available (after-tax contributions, tax-free growth)
- Can borrow from the plan (loan feature)

**Downside:** More paperwork. Must file Form 5500-EZ annually if plan assets exceed $250,000.

### Traditional IRA

**Best for:** Supplemental savings or if you have not set up a SEP or Solo 401(k).

- Contribute up to $7,000 (2024) + $1,000 catch-up if 50+
- Deductibility may be limited if you have other retirement plans
- Available at any brokerage

### Roth IRA

**Best for:** Younger freelancers in lower tax brackets.

- Contribute up to $7,000 (2024) after-tax
- Grows tax-free, withdrawals tax-free in retirement
- Income limits: Reduced contribution above $146,000 AGI (2024)
- Can withdraw contributions (not earnings) anytime without penalty

## Which to Choose

| Situation | Recommendation |
|-----------|---------------|
| Just starting out, low income | Roth IRA |
| Net income under $60,000 | Solo 401(k) (higher effective contribution) |
| Net income over $60,000 | SEP-IRA (simpler) or Solo 401(k) (more flexible) |
| Maximizing contributions | Solo 401(k) + Roth IRA (backdoor if income is high) |
| Want simplicity above all | SEP-IRA |

## How Much to Save

### The Baseline

15-20% of your gross income is the standard retirement savings target. If you started late, aim for 25%+.

### The Practical Approach

1. Max out your Roth IRA ($7,000)
2. Contribute to SEP-IRA or Solo 401(k) based on remaining capacity
3. If you cannot do both, prioritize the account that gives you the most tax benefit this year

### The Tax Benefit

A $20,000 SEP-IRA contribution at the 22% tax bracket saves you $4,400 in federal income tax plus reduces self-employment tax. The investment costs you $20,000 but reduces your tax bill by $5,000-$7,000 depending on your bracket.

## Setting It Up

### Step 1: Open an Account

Most major brokerages offer SEP-IRAs and Solo 401(k)s:
- Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab (lowest fees, broadest selection)
- Set up takes 15-30 minutes online

### Step 2: Automate Contributions

Set up a monthly transfer from your business account to your retirement account. Even $500/month ($6,000/year) is a meaningful start.

### Step 3: Invest Simply

A target-date fund or a three-fund portfolio (US stocks, international stocks, bonds) is all most freelancers need. Do not overcomplicate it.

## Important Notes

- This is general guidance, not financial advice
- Contribution limits change annually — verify current limits
- Consult a financial advisor or CPA for your specific situation
- Start now, even with small amounts — compound growth rewards time in the market
