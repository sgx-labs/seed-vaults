# Common Tax Deductions for Freelancers

## The Core Idea

Every legitimate business expense reduces your taxable income. If you are in the 22% tax bracket and deduct $10,000 in expenses, you save $2,200 in income tax plus roughly $1,500 in self-employment tax. The key is tracking expenses consistently and knowing what qualifies. When in doubt, log it and ask your CPA.

## Home Office Deduction

### Simplified Method

$5 per square foot of dedicated office space, up to 300 square feet. Maximum deduction: $1,500. No need to calculate actual expenses.

### Regular Method

Calculate the percentage of your home used exclusively for business. If your office is 150 sq ft and your home is 1,500 sq ft, you can deduct 10% of:
- Rent or mortgage interest
- Utilities
- Home insurance
- Repairs and maintenance

**Requirement:** The space must be used "regularly and exclusively" for business. A desk in the corner of your bedroom technically qualifies. A dining room table you also eat at does not.

## Technology and Software

- Computer hardware (laptop, monitor, keyboard, mouse)
- Software subscriptions (IDE, design tools, hosting, cloud services)
- Internet service (business-use percentage)
- Phone (business-use percentage)
- Domains and hosting
- SaaS tools (FreshBooks, Slack, project management)

## Professional Services

- Accountant/CPA fees
- Lawyer fees (contract review, business formation)
- Business insurance (general liability, professional liability/E&O)
- Tax preparation software

## Education and Development

- Courses and certifications relevant to your work
- Books and reference materials
- Conference attendance (registration, travel, accommodation)
- Professional association memberships

## Marketing and Business Development

- Website hosting and domain
- Business cards
- Portfolio hosting
- Advertising (Google Ads, social media ads)
- Client entertainment (50% deductible for meals)
- Networking events

## Travel

- Transportation to client sites
- Mileage for business driving (67 cents per mile for 2024, verify current year rate)
- Flights, hotels, and rental cars for business trips
- Meals while traveling (50% deductible)
- Parking and tolls

**Keep a mileage log.** Apps like MileIQ or Everlance make this easy.

## Insurance

- Health insurance premiums (self-employed health insurance deduction — this is a big one)
- Dental and vision insurance
- General liability insurance
- Professional liability / Errors & Omissions (E&O) insurance

The self-employed health insurance deduction is an "above the line" deduction, meaning it reduces your adjusted gross income, not just itemized deductions.

## Retirement Contributions

- SEP-IRA: Up to 25% of net self-employment income (max ~$69,000 for 2024)
- Solo 401(k): Higher contribution limits, both employee and employer portions
- Traditional IRA: Up to $7,000 (2024), may be deductible

Retirement contributions are one of the most powerful tax-reduction tools for freelancers.

## Other Common Deductions

- Bank fees on business accounts
- Postage and shipping
- Office supplies
- Coworking space membership
- Subscriptions relevant to your field
- Subcontractor payments (issue 1099s to contractors you pay $600+)

## What You Cannot Deduct

- Personal expenses (no matter how you justify them)
- Clothing (unless it is a uniform not suitable for everyday wear)
- Commuting to a permanent office
- Political contributions
- Fines and penalties

## Record-Keeping Requirements

- Keep receipts for all expenses over $75 (lower for meals)
- Maintain a log for travel and vehicle use
- Store records for at least 3 years (7 years is safer)
- Use accounting software to categorize expenses as you go
- Photograph receipts immediately — paper fades

## Important Notes

- This is general guidance, not tax advice
- Tax law and deduction limits change annually
- Consult a CPA for your specific situation
- The IRS does audit freelancers — maintain clean records
