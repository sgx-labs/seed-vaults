# Tax Basics for US Freelancers

## The Core Idea

As a freelancer, you are a business. You pay both the employee and employer portions of Social Security and Medicare taxes (self-employment tax), plus income tax. Nobody withholds taxes for you, so you are responsible for setting aside money and paying quarterly. The biggest surprise for new freelancers is not how much they owe — it is that the bill comes four times a year, not once.

## What You Owe

### Income Tax

Same federal and state income tax brackets as everyone else. The difference is nobody is withholding it from your paycheck. You calculate and pay it yourself.

### Self-Employment Tax

This is the big one new freelancers miss. As an employee, your employer pays half of Social Security and Medicare. As a freelancer, you pay both halves:

- Social Security: 12.4% (on income up to $168,600 for 2025)
- Medicare: 2.9% (no income cap)
- **Total: 15.3%**

You can deduct half of self-employment tax from your income (the "employer" portion).

### State and Local Taxes

Varies by state. Some states have no income tax (Texas, Florida, etc.). Others can add 5-13% on top of federal. Check your state's requirements.

## The Set-Aside Rule

**Immediately set aside 25-30% of every payment you receive into a separate savings account.** This covers both income tax and self-employment tax. Do not touch this money until tax time.

If you earn $100,000:
- Self-employment tax: ~$14,130
- Federal income tax: ~$12,000-$16,000 (depends on deductions)
- State tax: $0-$13,000 (depends on state)
- **Total: $26,000-$43,000**

The 25-30% rule covers most scenarios. Adjust based on your state.

## Key Tax Forms

| Form | What It Is | When You Get/File It |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| **1099-NEC** | Received from clients who paid you $600+ | By January 31 |
| **Schedule C** | Report business income and expenses | With your 1040 |
| **Schedule SE** | Calculate self-employment tax | With your 1040 |
| **Form 1040-ES** | Quarterly estimated tax payments | 4x per year |
| **1099-K** | From payment processors (Stripe, PayPal) | By January 31 |

Note: Starting with 2026 payments, the 1099-NEC threshold increases to $2,000.

## Record Keeping

### What to Track

- All income (invoices, payments, 1099s)
- All business expenses (software, hardware, travel, meals, home office)
- Mileage logs if you drive for business
- Health insurance premiums
- Retirement contributions

### How to Track

- Use accounting software (FreshBooks, QuickBooks — see `entities/freshbooks.md`)
- Keep receipts (digital is fine — take photos immediately)
- Separate business and personal bank accounts
- Reconcile monthly, not annually

## Common Mistakes

1. **Not setting money aside** — Spending everything and scrambling at tax time
2. **Missing quarterly payments** — Penalties and interest add up
3. **Not tracking deductions** — Overpaying because you did not claim legitimate expenses
4. **Mixing personal and business finances** — Makes tracking impossible
5. **Not getting professional help** — A CPA pays for themselves in tax savings
6. **Ignoring state taxes** — Multi-state clients can create nexus obligations

## When to Get a CPA

- Your first year of freelancing (to set up systems correctly)
- When your income exceeds $50,000 (entity structure conversation)
- If you have complex situations (multiple states, international clients, subcontractors)
- At minimum, for annual tax preparation

A good CPA for freelancers costs $300-$800 for annual preparation and is worth every dollar.

## Important Notes

- This is general tax guidance, not tax advice
- Tax law changes frequently — verify current rates and thresholds
- Consult a qualified tax professional for your specific situation
- The IRS Self-Employed Individuals Tax Center is a reliable free resource
