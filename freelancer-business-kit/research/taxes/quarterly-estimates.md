# Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments — How to Calculate and Pay

## The Core Idea

If you expect to owe $1,000 or more in taxes for the year, you must make quarterly estimated tax payments. Missing them triggers penalties, even if you pay the full amount by April 15. Think of it as paying your own withholding — four times a year instead of every paycheck.

## When Payments Are Due

| Quarter | Income Period | Federal Due Date |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Q1 | January 1 – March 31 | April 15 |
| Q2 | April 1 – May 31 | June 15 |
| Q3 | June 1 – August 31 | September 15 |
| Q4 | September 1 – December 31 | January 15 (next year) |

Note: Q2 covers only 2 months but Q3 covers 3. This is a common source of confusion.

If a due date falls on a weekend or holiday, the deadline moves to the next business day.

## How to Calculate Your Payment

### Method 1: Prior Year Safe Harbor (Simplest)

Pay 100% of your previous year's total tax liability, divided into 4 equal payments. This protects you from penalties even if you earn more this year.

**Exception:** If your adjusted gross income (AGI) was over $150,000 last year, you must pay 110% of last year's tax.

**Example:** Last year you owed $20,000 total. This year, pay $5,000 per quarter ($20,000 / 4).

### Method 2: Current Year Estimate (More Accurate)

Estimate your current year's income, deductions, and tax liability. Divide by 4.

1. Estimate total net self-employment income
2. Calculate self-employment tax (net income x 0.9235 x 0.153)
3. Calculate income tax on adjusted income
4. Add self-employment tax + income tax
5. Divide by 4

### Method 3: Annualized Income Method

If your income varies significantly by quarter (common for freelancers), use Form 2210 Schedule AI to calculate payments based on actual income per quarter.

## How to Pay

### IRS Direct Pay (Recommended)

- Go to irs.gov/payments
- Select "Estimated Tax" as the payment type
- Enter your information and bank account
- No fees for direct bank payment
- Save the confirmation number

### Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS)

- Register at eftps.gov (takes 5-7 days for PIN)
- Schedule payments in advance
- Good for setting up recurring quarterly payments

### IRS2Go Mobile App

- Pay from your phone
- Same options as the website

### State Estimated Taxes

Most states with income tax also require quarterly payments. Check your state's tax authority website for forms and due dates. These are separate from federal payments.

## Tracking Your Payments

Maintain a simple spreadsheet:

| Quarter | Due Date | Federal Paid | State Paid | Date Paid | Confirmation |
|---------|----------|-------------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| Q1 | Apr 15 | $X,XXX | $XXX | [date] | [number] |
| Q2 | Jun 15 | $X,XXX | $XXX | [date] | [number] |
| Q3 | Sep 15 | $X,XXX | $XXX | [date] | [number] |
| Q4 | Jan 15 | $X,XXX | $XXX | [date] | [number] |

## Penalties for Underpayment

The IRS charges a penalty if you do not pay enough estimated tax by each quarter's deadline. The penalty rate is the federal short-term interest rate plus 3 percentage points (roughly 7-8% in recent years).

**How to avoid penalties:**
- Pay at least 90% of the current year's tax, OR
- Pay 100% of last year's tax (110% if AGI was over $150,000)
- Make each payment on time — the safe harbor protects the amount, not late payments

## Tips

- Set calendar reminders 2 weeks before each deadline
- Automate payments through EFTPS if your income is predictable
- Round up your estimates slightly — an overpayment becomes a refund
- If your income spikes mid-year, adjust your remaining payments upward
- Keep all payment confirmations with your tax records
- Review estimates in September — you can adjust Q4 to make up for changes

## First Year of Freelancing

If this is your first year freelancing and you had zero self-employment tax liability last year, you technically do not need to make estimated payments this year. But you should anyway. The April 15 bill will be brutal if you wait.
