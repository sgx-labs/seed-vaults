# Hourly vs Project Pricing — Which to Use and When

## The Core Idea

Hourly pricing trades your time for money. Project pricing trades your output for money. Value-based pricing trades results for money. Each model has its place. The progression from hourly to project to value-based is how freelancers increase their income without working more hours.

## Hourly Pricing

### How It Works
You charge a fixed rate per hour worked. You track your time and invoice for actual hours.

### Advantages
- Simple to calculate and explain
- Fair when scope is undefined or likely to change
- Client sees exactly what they are paying for
- No risk of underestimating a project

### Disadvantages
- Caps your income (there are only so many hours in a day)
- Penalizes efficiency (faster work = less pay)
- Clients focus on hours rather than outcomes
- Creates an adversarial dynamic ("did that really take 3 hours?")

### When to Use
- Discovery/exploration projects where scope is truly unknown
- Ongoing maintenance or support work
- Consulting and advisory roles
- When the client insists and the rate is high enough

## Project-Based Pricing

### How It Works
You quote a fixed price for a defined scope of work. You deliver the output regardless of how long it takes.

### Advantages
- Rewards efficiency (finish faster, effective rate goes up)
- Clients know the total cost upfront (easier to get approval)
- Shifts focus from hours to deliverables
- Higher perceived value than hourly

### Disadvantages
- Risk of underestimating (scope creep eats your margins)
- Requires strong scoping skills
- Clients may push for "one more thing" within the fixed price
- Harder to price accurately for unfamiliar work

### When to Use
- Well-defined projects with clear deliverables
- Work you have done before and can estimate accurately
- Clients who care about outcomes, not process
- When you want to earn more by being efficient

### How to Protect Yourself
- Define scope exhaustively in the SOW
- List explicit exclusions
- Include a revision limit
- Add a clause for out-of-scope work at your hourly rate

## Value-Based Pricing

### How It Works
You price based on the business impact of your work, not the time or deliverables involved.

### Example
A landing page redesign takes you 20 hours. At $150/hour, that is $3,000. But the redesign increases conversions by 2%, generating an additional $50,000/year in revenue. Value-based pricing might set the fee at $8,000-$15,000.

### Advantages
- Highest margins
- Aligns your incentives with the client's outcomes
- Positions you as a strategic partner, not a vendor
- Income is decoupled from hours

### Disadvantages
- Requires confidence and experience to pitch
- Not all clients think in terms of business value
- Harder to justify if results are uncertain
- Need to deeply understand the client's business

### When to Use
- When you can tie your work to measurable business outcomes
- Clients with clear revenue goals
- Repeat work where you know the impact
- High-trust relationships

## The Progression

Most freelancers evolve through these stages:

| Stage | Model | Mindset |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Starting out | Hourly | "I need to prove my skills" |
| Established | Project | "I know what this work takes" |
| Expert | Value-based | "I know what this work is worth" |
| Scaled | Productized | "I have standardized what I do" |

## Hybrid Approaches

- **Project + hourly overflow:** Fixed price for defined scope, hourly rate for anything beyond it
- **Retainer + project:** Monthly retainer for ongoing work, project pricing for major initiatives
- **Tiered packages:** 3 options at different price points (see `research/proposals/writing-winning-proposals.md`)
