# When and How to Raise Your Rates

## The Core Idea

If you have not raised your rates in the last year, you have effectively given yourself a pay cut (inflation). If no prospect has ever said "that is too expensive," you are almost certainly underpriced. Raising rates is uncomfortable but necessary. It is the single highest-leverage action you can take for your business.

## When to Raise

### Clear Signals

- **You are booked solid.** If you have no availability, demand exceeds supply. Raise prices.
- **No one says no to your price.** A healthy closing rate is 30-50%. If you close 80%+, you are underpriced.
- **You resent the work.** If the pay does not match the effort, the rate is wrong.
- **Your skills have improved.** New certifications, frameworks, or deeper expertise justify higher rates.
- **It has been 6-12 months.** Annual rate reviews are the minimum.
- **You fired a client.** Replace them with a higher-paying one.

### Schedule It

Put "review rates" on your calendar every January and July. Do not wait for a trigger — make it a habit.

## How Much to Raise

- **Standard annual increase:** 10-20% for new clients
- **Market correction:** 25-50% if you discover you are significantly below market
- **Specialization premium:** 30-100% when you niche down to a high-value area
- **Existing clients:** 5-10% annually with advance notice

## How to Raise for New Clients

Just quote the new rate. No explanation needed. No apology. New clients do not know your old rate.

If your old rate was $100/hour, your new rate is $120/hour. Quote $120. If they negotiate, do not drop below $100.

## How to Raise for Existing Clients

### The Conversation

Give 30-60 days notice. Frame it as a business update, not a personal favor request.

**Template:**

"Hi [Client],

I wanted to give you advance notice that my rates will be updating effective [date — 30-60 days out]. My new rate is [new rate], which reflects [brief reason — increased demand, expanded capabilities, market adjustment].

For our current project scope, this means [specific impact]. I want to make this transition as smooth as possible, so I am happy to discuss any adjustments.

I value our working relationship and look forward to continuing to deliver great results for you.

Best,
[Your Name]"

### Tips for Existing Client Raises

- Never apologize for raising rates
- Give plenty of notice — 30 days minimum
- Offer a brief grandfathering period if the relationship is strong
- Be prepared for some clients to leave — that is okay and expected
- Replace lost revenue with new clients at the new rate

## Handling Pushback

### "We Cannot Afford That"

"I understand. My rate reflects the value I bring to your projects. If the new rate does not fit your budget, I am happy to adjust the scope of our work together."

### "But You Charged Us Less Before"

"My previous rate reflected where my business was at that time. As my expertise and demand have grown, my rates have evolved accordingly. I believe the value I deliver justifies the investment."

### "We Will Find Someone Cheaper"

"I completely understand the need to manage costs. I wish you the best, and the door is always open if you would like to work together again in the future."

## What Happens When You Raise Rates

- Some clients leave. This is healthy. They were price-sensitive, not value-sensitive.
- The clients who stay value your work, not just your price.
- New clients at the higher rate see you as more valuable (price signals quality).
- You earn more money working fewer hours or the same hours.
- You can afford to be more selective about the work you take on.

## The Compounding Effect

A $10/hour raise does not sound dramatic. But at 1,200 billable hours per year, that is $12,000 in additional annual revenue. Do that every year for five years and you have added $60,000 to your annual income.
