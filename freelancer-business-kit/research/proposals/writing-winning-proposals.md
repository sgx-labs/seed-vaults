# Writing Proposals That Win Projects

## The Core Idea

A proposal is not a price list. It is a document that demonstrates you understand the client's problem, have a clear plan to solve it, and are the right person for the job. The best proposals make the client feel understood before they see the price. When they trust your understanding, price becomes secondary.

## The Winning Proposal Structure

### 1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)

Restate the client's problem in your own words. This proves you listened. Do not start with "I am a developer with 10 years of experience." Start with their pain.

**Example:** "Your current checkout flow has a 67% abandonment rate, costing an estimated $15,000/month in lost revenue. The root cause appears to be a 4-step process that creates friction on mobile devices."

### 2. Understanding of the Problem (3-5 sentences)

Expand on what you learned in the discovery call. Reference specific things the client told you. This section builds trust.

### 3. Proposed Solution (the bulk)

Break it into phases or deliverables:
- What you will build/do
- Why this approach (briefly)
- What each phase delivers

Be specific. "Redesign the checkout flow" is vague. "Reduce the checkout to a single-page form with auto-fill, inline validation, and Apple/Google Pay integration" is concrete.

### 4. What Is NOT Included

This is the most underrated section. Explicitly list exclusions. This prevents scope creep and sets expectations.

**Example:** "This proposal does not include: backend API changes, email template redesign, A/B testing setup, or ongoing maintenance."

### 5. Timeline

Show a simple timeline with milestones. Include review periods and dependencies on the client (e.g., "Client provides content by Week 2").

### 6. Investment

Present 2-3 options when possible:
- **Option A (Essential):** Core deliverables only
- **Option B (Recommended):** Core + enhancements
- **Option C (Premium):** Full package with extras

This anchors the conversation and gives the client agency. Most choose Option B.

### 7. Why You

One paragraph. Relevant experience, a brief case study, or a testimonial. Keep it tight — this is supporting evidence, not the main argument.

### 8. Next Steps

Tell them exactly what happens if they say yes:
"Sign the attached agreement and submit the 50% deposit. I will schedule a kickoff call within 48 hours."

## Mistakes That Lose Projects

1. **Leading with your bio.** The client does not care about you yet. They care about their problem.
2. **Being vague about deliverables.** If you cannot define it, you cannot deliver it.
3. **No exclusions.** Everything not excluded is implicitly included in the client's mind.
4. **Only one price option.** A single price is a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.
5. **No timeline.** Clients need to know when, not just what.
6. **Sending a PDF and waiting.** Walk the client through the proposal on a call for high-value projects.

## Response Time Matters

Send your proposal within 48 hours of the discovery call. The longer you wait, the more the client's excitement cools and the more likely they are to pick a competitor who moved faster.

## Follow Up

If you do not hear back in 5 business days, send one follow-up:

"Hi [Client], I wanted to check in on the proposal I sent for [project]. Happy to jump on a quick call to address any questions or adjust the scope. Just let me know."

One follow-up. If they do not respond to that, move on.
