# How to Write a Scope of Work (SOW)

## The Core Idea

A Scope of Work is the technical companion to your contract. Where the contract handles legal terms, the SOW defines exactly what you will deliver, how, and when. A good SOW eliminates ambiguity. An ambiguous SOW is an invitation for scope creep.

## What a SOW Includes

### 1. Project Overview

Two to three sentences describing the project at a high level. This is for anyone who picks up the document — they should immediately understand what the project is about.

### 2. Objectives

What does the client want to achieve? Not what you will build — what business outcome they are after. This keeps both parties aligned on purpose.

**Example:** "Reduce checkout abandonment rate from 67% to under 40% by simplifying the purchase flow."

### 3. Deliverables

An exhaustive list of everything you will produce. Be specific.

**Vague:** "Website redesign"
**Specific:** "Responsive homepage design (desktop, tablet, mobile), 5 interior page templates, contact form with validation, integration with existing CMS"

Each deliverable should be verifiable — you can objectively determine whether it was delivered.

### 4. Exclusions

What you will NOT do. This is as important as the deliverables list.

**Example:** "This SOW does not include: content writing, photography, SEO optimization, hosting setup, ongoing maintenance, or third-party integrations beyond those specified."

### 5. Timeline and Milestones

Break the project into phases with dates:

| Phase | Deliverable | Duration | Due Date |
|-------|------------|----------|----------|
| Discovery | Requirements doc, sitemap | 1 week | [Date] |
| Design | Mockups for review | 2 weeks | [Date] |
| Development | Functional build | 3 weeks | [Date] |
| QA and Launch | Testing, deployment | 1 week | [Date] |

Include dependencies: "Phase 2 begins when client approves Phase 1 deliverables."

### 6. Client Responsibilities

What you need from the client, and when:
- Content and assets by [date]
- Feedback within [X] business days of submission
- Access to systems by [date]
- Decision-maker availability for approvals

**Delays from client push the timeline.** State this explicitly.

### 7. Revision Policy

Define what a revision is and how many are included:
- Number of revision rounds per deliverable (typically 2-3)
- What constitutes a revision vs. a new request
- Process for submitting feedback (consolidated, in writing)
- Rate for additional revisions beyond the included rounds

### 8. Acceptance Criteria

How will the client formally accept each deliverable? Define it:
- Client reviews deliverable within [X] business days
- Feedback provided in writing
- Deliverable is accepted when client provides written approval or when the review period expires without feedback

### 9. Change Control Process

How scope changes are handled:
1. Client or freelancer identifies a change
2. Freelancer prepares a change order with cost and timeline impact
3. Client approves or rejects the change order
4. No work on the change begins until the change order is signed

## SOW Writing Tips

- **Use numbered items.** Easy to reference in conversations: "Deliverable 3.2 is complete."
- **Avoid subjective language.** "Modern design" means different things to different people. "Clean layout with maximum 2 fonts, 3-color palette, and full-width hero section" is testable.
- **Version the SOW.** When changes happen, update the document and note the version. "SOW v1.2 — Updated 2026-03-15."
- **Both parties sign.** The SOW should be signed alongside the contract.
