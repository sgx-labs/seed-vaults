# Handling Revisions and Feedback Loops

## The Core Idea

Revisions are a normal part of creative and technical work. The problem is not revisions themselves — it is undefined revisions. When there is no limit, no process, and no cost to requesting changes, revision cycles become infinite. Define the rules upfront and revisions become a manageable, professional part of the project.

## Define It in the SOW

Every SOW should specify:

1. **Number of revision rounds** — Typically 2-3 per deliverable
2. **What counts as a revision** — Changes to an approved deliverable
3. **What counts as a new request** — Work outside the original scope
4. **How feedback is submitted** — In writing, consolidated, within a timeframe
5. **Cost of additional revisions** — Your hourly rate or a per-round fee

### Example Language

"This project includes 2 rounds of revisions per deliverable. A revision round consists of a single consolidated set of feedback submitted in writing. Revisions must be requested within 5 business days of deliverable submission. Additional revision rounds are billed at $[rate]/hour. Requests that alter the fundamental direction or scope of a deliverable are treated as new work and require a change order."

## The Revision Process

### Step 1: Deliver and Explain

When submitting work, include a brief explanation of your decisions. This reduces revision requests driven by misunderstanding:

"I chose this layout because it prioritizes mobile conversion, which was the primary goal. The hero section uses your brand colors with a high-contrast CTA based on current best practices."

### Step 2: Set a Review Deadline

"Please provide your consolidated feedback by [date]. If I do not hear back by then, I will proceed to the next phase."

### Step 3: Request Consolidated Feedback

Multiple rounds of piecemeal feedback ("change this... actually wait, also change that... one more thing...") eat time. Ask for all feedback in one batch:

"Please compile all feedback from your team into a single document. This helps me address everything efficiently in one revision round."

### Step 4: Categorize the Feedback

When you receive feedback, categorize each item:
- **Included revision:** Within scope, included in the revision round
- **Out of scope:** New work that requires a change order
- **Clarification needed:** Need more detail before implementing

Communicate the categorization before starting work.

### Step 5: Implement and Mark Complete

After completing the revision, confirm what was changed and mark the revision round as used: "Revision round 1 of 2 is now complete. Here is what was updated: [list]."

## Preventing Infinite Feedback Loops

### The "Final Review" Technique

Before the last included revision round, communicate: "This is the final included revision round. Please be thorough in your feedback. Additional revisions after this round will be billed at $[rate]/hour."

### The Approval Gate

Require formal written approval at each milestone before proceeding. An approved deliverable that later needs changes counts as a new revision round, not a continuation of the previous one.

### The "Design by Committee" Problem

When multiple stakeholders provide conflicting feedback, do not attempt to synthesize it yourself. Respond:

"I have received feedback from [names/roles] with some conflicting direction. Could you designate one person to compile and prioritize the feedback? I want to make sure the revisions align with your team's consensus."

## When Revisions Exceed the Limit

### Communicate Before Working

"We have used both included revision rounds. I am happy to continue refining — additional revisions are billed at $[rate]/hour. Shall I proceed?"

### Send a Change Order

For significant additional work, create a mini change order:
- What is being changed
- Estimated hours
- Cost
- Impact on timeline

Get approval before starting.

## Tips

- Track revision rounds per deliverable, not per project
- Keep a log of all feedback received and revisions made
- The more specific your deliverables, the more objective revision requests become
- Revision limits protect both parties — they force the client to prioritize and prevent the project from dragging on indefinitely
