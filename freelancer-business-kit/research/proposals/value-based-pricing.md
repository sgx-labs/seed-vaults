# Value-Based Pricing — Charging What the Work Is Worth

## The Core Idea

Value-based pricing means setting your price based on the business impact of your work, not the hours it takes. A developer who builds a feature that generates $500,000 in annual revenue should not charge based on the 40 hours it took to build it. They should charge based on the value they created.

## When Value-Based Pricing Works

### Good Candidates

- The client has a clear, measurable business goal (increase revenue, reduce costs)
- You can directly tie your work to that outcome
- The client's budget is driven by ROI, not cost comparison
- You have enough experience to estimate impact confidently
- The value of the outcome significantly exceeds the cost of your time

### Poor Candidates

- The client has no clear metrics or goals
- The outcome depends on many factors beyond your control
- The client is comparing you against hourly-rate freelancers
- You cannot articulate the value in business terms
- The project is maintenance or commodity work

## How to Price on Value

### Step 1: Quantify the Business Impact

During discovery, ask value-revealing questions:
- "What is this problem costing you today?" (in dollars, time, or opportunity cost)
- "What would solving this be worth to the business?"
- "What is the expected revenue or savings from this project?"
- "What is the cost of not doing this project?"

### Step 2: Calculate Your Price

A common framework: charge 10-20% of the expected value.

**Example:**
- Client's checkout abandonment costs $200,000/year
- Your redesign is projected to reduce abandonment by 30%
- Expected savings: $60,000/year
- Your price: $6,000-$12,000 (10-20% of first-year impact)

The client sees 5-10x ROI. You earn significantly more than hourly billing would have produced.

### Step 3: Frame It as an Investment

"This project is a $10,000 investment that is projected to generate $60,000 in recovered revenue in the first year alone."

Never say "cost." Always say "investment." Investments produce returns. Costs are expenses.

## Presenting Value-Based Pricing

### The Three-Option Approach

Present tiers anchored to business outcomes:

| Option | Deliverable | Expected Impact | Investment |
|--------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Core | Basic solution | Addresses the primary problem | $X |
| Recommended | Enhanced solution | Primary problem + optimization | $Y |
| Premium | Comprehensive solution | Maximum impact + ongoing support | $Z |

### The ROI Narrative

Walk the client through the math:
1. Current state: "You are losing $X per month to [problem]"
2. Future state: "After this project, that drops to $Y per month"
3. Net impact: "That is $Z per year in [savings/revenue]"
4. Your investment: "The project investment of $A pays for itself in [B] months"

## The Confidence Factor

Value-based pricing requires confidence. If you hesitate when stating your price, the client feels it. Practice:

- Say your price out loud until it feels natural
- Remember: you are saving/making the client far more than you are charging
- If the client does not flinch, you may still be underpriced
- A 30-50% close rate means your price is in the right range

## Transitioning from Hourly to Value-Based

You do not switch overnight. The progression:

1. **Track your outcomes.** Start measuring the business impact of your work, even if you are billing hourly.
2. **Ask value questions.** During discovery, ask about business goals and impact.
3. **Present value alongside hourly.** "Based on scope, this is 40 hours at $150/hour ($6,000). Based on the projected impact of $50,000/year, I would recommend a project fee of $8,000."
4. **Anchor on value.** Eventually, present value pricing first and hourly as the alternative.
5. **Drop hourly entirely.** Once you are confident in value conversations, stop quoting hourly rates.

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Client does not see the value | Better discovery questions, walk away if value is unclear |
| Results do not materialize | Price based on projected value, not guaranteed outcomes |
| Client compares to hourly rates | Reframe the conversation to ROI, not hours |
| You underestimate the scope | Include a scope buffer and clear change order process |

## Important Note

Value-based pricing is advanced. It requires strong discovery skills, industry knowledge, and the ability to have business-level conversations. Master hourly and project-based pricing first. Introduce value-based pricing gradually as you build confidence and a track record of measurable results.
