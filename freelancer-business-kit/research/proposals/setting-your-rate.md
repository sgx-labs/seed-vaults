# How to Set Your Freelance Rate

## The Core Idea

Your rate is not what you think your time is worth — it is a business calculation. It must cover your expenses, taxes, non-billable time, benefits you no longer get from an employer, and profit. Most freelancers undercharge, especially in their first year.

## The Rate Calculation

### Step 1: Target Annual Income

What do you need to earn after all business expenses? Start with your previous salary or your desired income.

**Example:** $100,000 target income

### Step 2: Add Business Costs

Costs your employer used to cover:
- Health insurance: ~$6,000-$12,000/year
- Retirement contributions: ~$5,000-$10,000/year
- Software and tools: ~$2,000-$5,000/year
- Accounting/legal: ~$1,000-$3,000/year
- Home office/coworking: ~$1,200-$6,000/year
- Marketing/website: ~$500-$2,000/year
- Insurance (liability, E&O): ~$500-$2,000/year

**Example:** $100,000 + $20,000 costs = $120,000

### Step 3: Add Self-Employment Tax

Self-employment tax is approximately 15.3% (Social Security + Medicare). Plus income tax. A safe estimate is 25-30% of gross income for taxes.

**Example:** $120,000 / 0.70 = ~$171,000 gross needed

### Step 4: Calculate Billable Hours

You do not work 2,080 hours per year (40 hrs/week x 52 weeks). Subtract:
- Vacation: 3-4 weeks (120-160 hours)
- Holidays: 10 days (80 hours)
- Sick days: 5 days (40 hours)
- Non-billable work (admin, sales, marketing): 20-30% of remaining time

Realistic billable hours: **1,000-1,400 hours per year** for most freelancers.

**Example:** $171,000 / 1,200 billable hours = ~$143/hour

### Step 5: Reality Check

Compare your calculated rate against:
- Market rates for your skill and experience level
- What clients in your target market typically pay
- Rates on platforms like Upwork and Glassdoor
- What peers charge (ask them — most freelancers share)

If your rate is above market, you either need to specialize further or target higher-value clients.

## Rate Benchmarks (US, 2025-2026)

| Skill Level | Hourly Range |
|-------------|-------------|
| Junior (0-2 years) | $40-$75 |
| Mid-level (2-5 years) | $75-$150 |
| Senior (5-10 years) | $125-$250 |
| Expert/Specialist (10+ years) | $200-$500+ |

These ranges vary significantly by specialization, industry, and geography.

## The Freelance Rate Multiplier

A common rule of thumb: your freelance hourly rate should be approximately **1.5-2x your equivalent full-time hourly rate** to account for taxes, benefits, and non-billable time.

**Example:** If a full-time job pays $80/hr ($166K salary), your freelance rate should be $120-$160/hr.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Basing your rate on your salary.** Your salary does not account for benefits, taxes, or non-billable time.
2. **Competing on price.** Cheap freelancers attract cheap clients. Race to the bottom ends at the bottom.
3. **Charging the same rate for everything.** Strategic consulting is worth more per hour than routine implementation.
4. **Not tracking your effective rate.** Hours that bleed beyond estimates lower your actual rate. Track it.
5. **Freezing your rate.** Review and adjust every 6-12 months. See `research/proposals/when-to-raise-rates.md`.

## Setting Project Rates

For project-based pricing, estimate the hours, multiply by your hourly rate, then add a 15-25% buffer for unknowns:

**Project rate = (estimated hours x hourly rate) x 1.20**

The buffer accounts for scope clarification, revisions, and communication overhead that always takes longer than expected.
