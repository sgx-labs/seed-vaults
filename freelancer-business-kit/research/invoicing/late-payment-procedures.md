# Late Payment Procedures — How to Get Paid When Clients Are Overdue

## The Core Idea

85% of freelancers experience late payments. It is not if, it is when. Having a documented escalation procedure removes the emotion from the process and ensures you act consistently. The earlier you follow up, the faster you get paid. Silence is the worst strategy.

## The Escalation Timeline

### Day 1 Past Due — Friendly Reminder

**Channel:** Email
**Tone:** Friendly, assumes oversight

"Hi [Client],

Just a quick note that invoice [number] for $[amount] was due on [date]. In case it slipped through, I have attached the invoice again for convenience.

[Payment link]

Thank you,
[Your Name]"

### Day 7 Past Due — Firm Follow-Up

**Channel:** Email
**Tone:** Professional, direct

"Hi [Client],

I am following up on invoice [number] for $[amount], which is now 7 days past due. Per our agreement, a late fee of [1.5%] per month applies to overdue balances.

Please let me know if there are any issues with processing this payment. I would like to resolve it promptly.

Best,
[Your Name]"

### Day 14 Past Due — Phone Call + Written Notice

**Channel:** Phone call followed by email
**Tone:** Serious, solution-oriented

Call the client directly. Be calm and direct: "I am calling about invoice [number], which is now two weeks overdue. I want to understand if there is an issue and find a resolution."

Follow up the call in writing:

"Hi [Client],

Following up on our conversation today regarding invoice [number] for $[amount], which is now 14 days past due. As discussed, [whatever was agreed].

Per our contract, late fees of [amount] have been applied. The total now due is $[amount + late fees].

Please confirm receipt of this email and the expected payment date.

Best,
[Your Name]"

### Day 21 Past Due — Formal Demand

**Channel:** Email (consider certified mail for large amounts)
**Tone:** Formal

"Dear [Client],

This is a formal notice that invoice [number] for $[amount] is now 21 days past due. Including the contractual late fee of [1.5%] per month, the total balance is $[amount].

Payment is expected within 7 business days. If I do not receive payment by [specific date], I will need to [pause all work / pursue formal collection].

I sincerely hope we can resolve this without further escalation.

Regards,
[Your Name]"

### Day 30 Past Due — Work Stoppage

Stop all work for this client. Communicate clearly:

"Dear [Client],

Due to the outstanding balance of $[amount] (now 30 days past due), I am pausing all work on [project] effective immediately. Work will resume when the outstanding balance is paid in full.

Please note that the project timeline will be adjusted accordingly.

Regards,
[Your Name]"

### Day 60+ — Collections / Legal Action

For significant amounts:
- Send a final demand letter (consider having a lawyer draft it)
- File a complaint with your state's attorney general if applicable
- Consider small claims court (typically for amounts under $5,000-$10,000)
- Engage a collections agency (they typically take 25-50% of the recovered amount)

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Require deposits** — 30-50% upfront for all projects
2. **Milestone payments** — Never let more than 2 weeks of work go unbilled
3. **Vet clients** — Check references and look for payment history on platforms
4. **Automate reminders** — Use FreshBooks or similar to send automatic reminders
5. **Late fees in the contract** — Include them and enforce them consistently
6. **Short payment terms** — Net 15, not Net 30 or longer

## When to Write It Off

Sometimes a client simply will not pay. Consider writing it off when:
- The amount is small relative to the collection effort
- The client is unreachable or defunct
- Legal action would cost more than the amount owed
- The stress of pursuing it outweighs the financial benefit

Log the loss, learn from the red flags you missed, and move on.

## Legal Protections to Know About

- **California Freelance Worker Protection Act (2025):** Requires written contracts for work over $250 and payment within 30 days
- **New York Freelance Isn't Free Act:** Similar protections for NYC freelancers
- **Federal protections:** Limited, but check your state's specific laws
- **Small claims court:** Available in every US state, no lawyer needed, filing fees under $100
