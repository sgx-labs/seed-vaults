# Invoice Best Practices — Get Paid Faster

## The Core Idea

An invoice is not just a bill — it is a communication tool. A clear, professional invoice gets paid faster than a vague one. The goal is to remove every possible friction point between the client receiving your invoice and clicking "pay." Every day an invoice sits unpaid costs you real money.

## Invoice Essentials

Every invoice should include:

1. **Your business name and contact info**
2. **Client's name and billing contact**
3. **Unique invoice number** (sequential: INV-001, INV-002...)
4. **Invoice date**
5. **Due date** (not "Net 15" — spell out the actual date)
6. **Itemized line items** with descriptions
7. **Total amount due**
8. **Payment methods accepted** with instructions
9. **Late fee policy** (reference the contract)
10. **A direct payment link** (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)

## Formatting Tips

### Make the Amount Obvious

The total due should be the most prominent element on the invoice. Large font, bold, clear placement. The client should know how much they owe within 2 seconds of opening the document.

### Use Specific Due Dates

"Due: March 15, 2026" is better than "Net 15." A specific date removes ambiguity and is harder to negotiate after the fact.

### Itemize Your Work

Do not send a single line item that says "Web development — $5,000." Break it down:

| Description | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Discovery and requirements (Phase 1) | $1,500 |
| Design mockups — 3 pages (Phase 2) | $2,000 |
| Development and testing (Phase 3) | $1,500 |
| **Total** | **$5,000** |

Itemization shows value and reduces "what am I paying for?" questions.

### Include a Personal Note

A brief note humanizes the invoice: "Thank you for a great project. Looking forward to hearing how the launch goes."

## Timing

### Invoice Immediately

Send the invoice the same day the milestone is completed or the work is delivered. Waiting even a few days pushes payment further out.

### Recurring Work

For retainer clients, send invoices on the same date each month. Consistency makes paying you a habit, not a decision.

### Before You Deliver Final Work

For milestone-based projects, invoice and receive payment before delivering the final files. Your contract should support this: "Final deliverables are released upon receipt of final payment."

## Getting Paid Faster

1. **Accept multiple payment methods** — Credit card, ACH, wire. Make it easy.
2. **Include a payment link** — One click should be all it takes.
3. **Send to the right person** — Get the accounts payable contact on day one.
4. **Automate reminders** — Set up automatic reminders at 3 days before, on the due date, and 3 days after.
5. **Offer a small early payment discount** — "2% discount if paid within 5 days" (optional, not for everyone).
6. **Invoice on the client's billing cycle** — If they process payments on the 1st and 15th, time your invoices accordingly.

## Common Invoicing Mistakes

1. **Waiting to invoice** — Delayed invoicing signals that payment is not urgent.
2. **Vague line items** — "Consulting services" tells the client nothing.
3. **Missing due date** — If there is no due date, it is due whenever the client feels like it.
4. **No late fee** — No consequences for late payment means late payment is free.
5. **Wrong contact** — Your point of contact may not handle payments. Get the AP email.
6. **Manual invoicing** — Use invoicing software. See `research/invoicing/tools-comparison.md`.
