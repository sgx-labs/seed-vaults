# Freelancer Tools Comparison — Invoicing, Contracts, Time Tracking

## The Core Idea

You need three categories of tools: invoicing/accounting, contracts/proposals, and time tracking. You can use separate best-of-breed tools or an all-in-one platform. The best tool is the one you actually use consistently. Start simple and add complexity only when you outgrow it.

## Invoicing and Accounting

| Tool | Monthly Cost | Best For | Key Strength |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **FreshBooks** | $19-$60 | Solo freelancers | Easiest to use, great mobile app |
| **QuickBooks Self-Employed** | $15-$30 | Tax prep | Strong tax categorization |
| **Wave** | Free | Budget-conscious | Free invoicing and accounting |
| **Xero** | $15-$78 | International freelancers | Multi-currency, strong integrations |
| **Bonsai** | $25-$79 | All-in-one workflow | Contracts + invoicing + proposals |

**Recommendation for starting out:** FreshBooks (Lite plan) or Wave (free). See `entities/freshbooks.md` for detailed setup.

## Contracts and Proposals

| Tool | Monthly Cost | Best For | Key Strength |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Bonsai** | $25-$79 | Freelancer-specific | Templates designed for freelancers |
| **HoneyBook** | $19-$79 | Creative freelancers | Beautiful proposals, client portal |
| **PandaDoc** | $19-$65 | Complex proposals | Tracking, analytics, e-signatures |
| **HelloSign** | $15-$25 | Just e-signatures | Simple, integrates with everything |
| **DocuSign** | $10-$40 | Enterprise clients | Most recognized, legally robust |

**Recommendation:** Start with HelloSign or DocuSign for signatures. Use the templates in this vault for proposals and contracts.

## Time Tracking

| Tool | Monthly Cost | Best For | Key Strength |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Toggl Track** | Free-$18 | Simple tracking | One-click timer, great reports |
| **Harvest** | Free-$12/user | Invoicing integration | Time tracking to invoice pipeline |
| **Clockify** | Free-$12 | Budget-conscious | Generous free tier |
| **RescueTime** | Free-$12 | Passive tracking | Automatic, runs in background |

**Recommendation:** Toggl Track (free tier) for active tracking. Track time even on project-based work to understand your effective rate.

## Scheduling

| Tool | Monthly Cost | Best For | Key Strength |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Calendly** | Free-$20 | Most freelancers | Simple, professional, widely known |
| **Cal.com** | Free-$15 | Open-source preference | Self-hostable, customizable |
| **SavvyCal** | $12-$20 | Client experience | Overlay scheduling |
| **TidyCal** | $29 one-time | Budget-conscious | No monthly fee |

**Recommendation:** Calendly (free tier to start). See `entities/calendly.md` for setup.

## Project Management

| Tool | Monthly Cost | Best For | Key Strength |
|------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Notion** | Free-$10 | Flexible workspace | All-in-one notes, tasks, databases |
| **Trello** | Free-$10 | Visual project tracking | Kanban boards, simple drag-drop |
| **Linear** | Free-$8 | Developer freelancers | Fast, keyboard-first, modern |
| **Asana** | Free-$11 | Multi-project management | Powerful views and automation |
| **Todoist** | Free-$5 | Simple task lists | Clean, fast, minimal overhead |

**Recommendation:** Pick the lightest tool that works for you. A text file beats a complex system you don't use.

## Payment Processing

| Tool | Transaction Fee | Best For | Key Strength |
|------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **Stripe** | 2.9% + $0.30 | Direct invoicing | Developer-friendly, ACH option |
| **PayPal** | 3.49% + $0.49 | Client recognition | Everyone has it |
| **Wise** | 0.5-1.5% | International | Best forex rates |
| **Square** | 2.6% + $0.10 | In-person work | Reader + online together |

**Recommendation:** Stripe for online payments. See `entities/stripe.md` for setup.

## The Minimalist Stack

If you want the simplest possible setup:
1. **FreshBooks** (invoicing + time tracking + expenses)
2. **HelloSign** (contracts)
3. **Calendly** (scheduling)
4. **Stripe** (payments, connected to FreshBooks)

Total cost: Under $40/month. Handles 90% of freelance business operations.
