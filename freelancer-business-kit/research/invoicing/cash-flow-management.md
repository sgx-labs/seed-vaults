# Cash Flow Management for Freelancers

## The Core Idea

Revenue is not cash flow. You can have $100,000 in signed contracts and not enough money to pay rent this month. Cash flow — the actual movement of money in and out of your accounts — is what keeps your business alive. Managing it is the single most important financial skill for a freelancer.

## The Freelancer Cash Flow Problem

Employees get paid on a predictable schedule. Freelancers do not. Your income arrives in lumps:
- A big project payment hits, then nothing for 3 weeks
- Multiple invoices go out at once, but clients pay at different speeds
- Tax payments are due quarterly, not spread across paychecks
- Slow months happen even when you are doing everything right

## The Three-Account System

Separate your money into three accounts:

### 1. Business Operating Account

Where all client payments land. All business expenses come from here. This account should maintain a buffer of at least one month of business expenses.

### 2. Tax Savings Account

Transfer 25-30% of every payment immediately. This money is not yours — it belongs to the IRS and your state. Do not touch it except for quarterly tax payments.

### 3. Personal Account

Transfer your "salary" from the business account on a regular schedule (biweekly or monthly). This is what you live on. Treat it like a paycheck even though you are paying yourself.

## Forecasting Cash Flow

### The Simple Forecast

Maintain a rolling 3-month forecast:

| Month | Expected Income | Confirmed Income | Expected Expenses | Cash Position |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| March | $12,000 | $8,000 | $6,000 | $X |
| April | $10,000 | $4,000 | $6,000 | $Y |
| May | $8,000 | $0 | $6,000 | $Z |

"Confirmed income" is money from signed contracts with invoiced or imminent milestones. "Expected income" includes probable but not confirmed work.

### Warning Signs

- Confirmed income does not cover next month's expenses
- More than 2 invoices are overdue
- No new projects in the pipeline for 30+ days
- Tax savings account is below next quarter's estimated payment

## Strategies for Smoothing Cash Flow

### Require Deposits

30-50% upfront deposits smooth income timing. A $10,000 project with a 50% deposit means $5,000 on signing day, not $10,000 in 6 weeks.

### Shorter Payment Terms

Net 15 instead of Net 30. Every day sooner you get paid improves your cash position.

### Retainer Revenue

Even one retainer client paying $2,000/month provides a predictable baseline. See `research/growth/recurring-revenue.md`.

### Invoice Immediately

Send invoices the day a milestone is complete. Every day you delay invoicing is a day added to your payment cycle.

### Stagger Project Starts

If possible, stagger new projects so payments arrive at different times rather than all at once (followed by a gap).

### Build a Cash Reserve

Aim for 3 months of expenses in your business account beyond the operating buffer. This reserve lets you survive slow periods without panic.

## When Cash Flow Gets Tight

### Short-Term Fixes

1. Follow up on all outstanding invoices immediately
2. Offer an early payment discount to clients with large outstanding balances
3. Invoice any completed work that has not been billed yet
4. Reduce discretionary business expenses temporarily
5. Delay non-essential purchases

### Medium-Term Fixes

1. Accelerate your sales pipeline — reach out to warm leads
2. Offer a quick-turnaround productized service
3. Explore agency or subcontracting work for fast revenue
4. Consider a short-term project on a platform like Upwork

### What Not to Do

- Do not skip quarterly tax payments (penalties make it worse)
- Do not take on a bad client out of desperation (costs more long-term)
- Do not ignore the problem (it does not fix itself)

## The Monthly Financial Ritual

On the first of every month, spend 30 minutes:

1. Review all outstanding invoices and follow up on overdue ones
2. Update your 3-month cash flow forecast
3. Transfer tax savings from operating account
4. Pay yourself (transfer to personal account)
5. Review upcoming expenses (subscriptions, quarterly taxes)
6. Assess pipeline health — is next month covered?
