# Essential Contract Clauses Every Freelancer Needs

## The Core Idea

Your contract is your insurance policy. It protects your income, your intellectual property, and your sanity. You do not need a lawyer to draft every contract (though having one review your template is worth the investment). You do need to understand what each clause does and why it matters.

## The 10 Essential Clauses

### 1. Scope of Work

Defines exactly what you will deliver. References the attached SOW for details. This is the most-referenced clause when disputes arise.

**Key language:** "Freelancer will provide the services described in the attached Scope of Work (Exhibit A). Any work not explicitly described in the SOW is outside the scope of this agreement."

### 2. Payment Terms

How much, when, and how.

**Key language:** "Client will pay Freelancer [amount] according to the payment schedule in Exhibit A. Invoices are due within [15] days of receipt. Payments not received within [15] days of the due date will incur a late fee of [1.5%] per month."

### 3. Payment Schedule

For project work, define the milestone structure:
- Deposit: 30-50% due upon signing
- Milestone payments: At defined deliverable checkpoints
- Final payment: Due before final deliverable handoff

**Key language:** "A non-refundable deposit of [X%] is due upon execution of this agreement. Final payment is due upon completion of all deliverables and prior to transfer of final files."

### 4. Intellectual Property

Who owns what, and when ownership transfers.

**Key language:** "All intellectual property created under this agreement remains the property of Freelancer until final payment is received in full. Upon receipt of final payment, Freelancer assigns all rights, title, and interest in the deliverables to Client. Freelancer retains the right to display the work in their portfolio."

### 5. Revision and Change Policy

Limits on revisions and process for scope changes.

**Key language:** "This agreement includes [2] rounds of revisions per deliverable. Additional revisions will be billed at $[rate]/hour. Changes to the project scope require a written change order signed by both parties before work begins."

### 6. Timeline and Delays

Project schedule with provisions for delays on either side.

**Key language:** "The project timeline is outlined in Exhibit A. Delays caused by Client (including late feedback, delayed access, or changed requirements) will extend the timeline by a corresponding period. Rush requests may incur additional fees."

### 7. Termination

How either party can end the agreement.

**Key language:** "Either party may terminate this agreement with [14/30] days written notice. Upon termination, Client will pay for all work completed to date. If Client terminates without cause, a kill fee of [25-50%] of the remaining project value applies."

### 8. Confidentiality

Mutual protection of sensitive information.

**Key language:** "Both parties agree to keep confidential any proprietary information shared during this engagement. This obligation survives termination of the agreement for a period of [2] years."

### 9. Limitation of Liability

Caps your financial exposure.

**Key language:** "Freelancer's total liability under this agreement shall not exceed the total fees paid by Client under this agreement. In no event shall Freelancer be liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages."

### 10. Independent Contractor Status

Establishes the working relationship.

**Key language:** "Freelancer is an independent contractor, not an employee of Client. Freelancer is responsible for their own taxes, insurance, and benefits. Nothing in this agreement creates an employer-employee relationship."

## Additional Clauses to Consider

- **Non-solicitation:** Prevents the client from hiring your subcontractors directly
- **Force majeure:** Covers unforeseeable events that prevent performance
- **Dispute resolution:** Mediation or arbitration before litigation
- **Portfolio rights:** Explicit permission to showcase the work
- **Non-compete considerations:** Be cautious — overly broad non-competes can harm your business

## Important Notes

- This is general guidance, not legal advice
- Have a lawyer review your contract template at least once
- State-specific laws may affect enforceability of certain clauses
- California, New York, and other states have specific freelancer protection laws
- Keep your contract as short and readable as possible — a 20-page contract scares clients
