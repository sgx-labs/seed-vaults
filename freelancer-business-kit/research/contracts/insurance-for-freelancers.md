# Insurance for Freelancers — What You Need and What You Don't

## The Core Idea

As a freelancer, you do not have an employer's umbrella protecting you. Insurance is how you transfer risk from your personal balance sheet to an insurance company. The right insurance prevents a single mistake or lawsuit from wiping out your savings. It is not optional once you have real income at stake.

## Health Insurance (Required)

### Options

| Source | Cost | Best For |
|--------|------|----------|
| **ACA Marketplace** | $200-$800/month (subsidies may apply) | Most freelancers |
| **COBRA** | Former employer rate + 2% admin | First 18 months after leaving a job |
| **Spouse's plan** | Varies | If available |
| **Health sharing ministries** | $150-$500/month | Those who qualify and accept limitations |
| **Professional associations** | Varies | Some offer group rates |

**Action:** If leaving a job, apply through healthcare.gov within 60 days (qualifying life event). Compare COBRA vs. marketplace plans — marketplace may be cheaper with subsidies.

## General Liability Insurance

Covers bodily injury and property damage claims. If a client visits your home office and trips, or if your work somehow causes physical damage, this covers you.

- **Cost:** $300-$600/year for most freelancers
- **Who needs it:** Anyone who meets clients in person or works on-site
- **Coverage:** Typically $1M per occurrence, $2M aggregate

## Professional Liability / Errors & Omissions (E&O)

Covers claims that your professional work caused financial harm to a client. If your code has a bug that costs the client money, or your design advice leads to a poor outcome, E&O covers legal defense and settlements.

- **Cost:** $500-$2,000/year depending on coverage and profession
- **Who needs it:** All freelancers, especially developers, designers, and consultants
- **Coverage:** $1M per claim is standard

This is the most important insurance for freelancers beyond health insurance.

## Cyber Liability Insurance

Covers data breaches, hacking incidents, and cyber-related claims. If you handle client data, financial information, or have access to their systems, a breach could be catastrophic.

- **Cost:** $500-$1,500/year
- **Who needs it:** Developers, anyone with access to client data or systems
- **Coverage:** Breach notification, legal costs, data recovery

## Business Property Insurance

Covers your business equipment (laptop, monitors, etc.) against theft, damage, or loss. Your homeowner's or renter's insurance may have limited coverage for business equipment.

- **Cost:** $100-$400/year
- **Who needs it:** Anyone whose equipment is their livelihood

## What You Probably Don't Need (Yet)

- **Workers' compensation** — Only needed if you have employees
- **Commercial auto** — Only if you use a vehicle primarily for business
- **Product liability** — Only if you sell physical products
- **Key person insurance** — Only relevant for larger operations

## Where to Buy

- **Next Insurance** — Fast quotes, designed for freelancers
- **Hiscox** — Popular for professional liability
- **Hartford** — Broad coverage options
- **Insurance brokers** — Can shop multiple carriers for you

## The Minimum Stack

For most freelancers:
1. Health insurance (required)
2. Professional liability / E&O ($500-$1,500/year)
3. General liability if meeting clients ($300-$600/year)

Total for business insurance: $800-$2,100/year. Fully tax-deductible.
