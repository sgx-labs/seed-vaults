# IP and Ownership — Protecting Your Work

## The Core Idea

Who owns the work you create? Without a contract, copyright law gets complicated. With a clear IP clause, both sides know exactly where they stand. The default position for freelancers: you own everything until the client pays in full. On full payment, ownership transfers. Simple, fair, and protective.

## How Copyright Works for Freelancers

### Default Rules (Without a Contract)

In the US, the creator owns the copyright. Unlike employees (whose work belongs to the employer under "work for hire"), freelancer-created work belongs to the freelancer by default. A client who pays for the work has an implied license to use it, but does not own the copyright.

### With a Contract

A written agreement can assign copyright to the client. This is standard practice for most client work. The key is controlling when that assignment happens — and the answer should be "when you get paid."

## The Recommended IP Clause Structure

### During the Project

"All work product created by Freelancer during this engagement is owned by Freelancer until final payment is received. Client receives a limited, non-transferable license to review and evaluate the work during the project."

### On Final Payment

"Upon receipt of final payment in full, Freelancer hereby assigns to Client all rights, title, and interest in the deliverables described in the SOW, including copyright."

### Portfolio Rights

"Notwithstanding the above assignment, Freelancer retains the right to display and reference the work in their portfolio, website, and marketing materials for the purpose of showcasing their professional capabilities."

### Pre-Existing Materials

"Any tools, frameworks, libraries, or methodologies created by Freelancer prior to or independent of this engagement ('Pre-Existing Materials') remain the property of Freelancer. To the extent Pre-Existing Materials are incorporated into the deliverables, Client receives a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use them as part of the delivered work."

## Common IP Scenarios

### Client Wants Full Ownership Immediately

**Your response:** "I am happy to assign all IP on final payment. During the project, I retain ownership as standard practice — it protects both of us."

### Client Wants to Own Your Tools and Frameworks

**Your response:** "The deliverables will be fully yours. The underlying tools I use across multiple clients remain mine — you get a perpetual license to use them within your project. This is the same arrangement I have with all clients."

### Client Asks for "Work for Hire" Status

**Be careful.** Work-for-hire means the client owns everything from the moment of creation, and you have no rights. This is appropriate for employees, not independent contractors. If a client insists, increase your rate to compensate.

### Source Code Ownership

For developers: clarify whether the client gets source code or just compiled/deployed output. Most clients should get source code on final payment, but clarify expectations.

### Open-Source Contributions

If your work involves open-source libraries: "Freelancer may utilize open-source software in accordance with their respective licenses. Client acknowledges that such software remains governed by its original license terms."

## Protecting Yourself

1. **Never deliver final files before final payment.** Send watermarked mockups, staging environments, or reduced-quality previews.
2. **Keep backups of everything you create.** Even after IP transfers, maintain copies for your records and portfolio.
3. **Document pre-existing materials.** If you use your own frameworks, document them before the project starts.
4. **Get IP assignments in writing.** Verbal agreements are unenforceable for copyright assignment.
