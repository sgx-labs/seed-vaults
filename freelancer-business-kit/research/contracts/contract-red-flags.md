# Contract Red Flags — What to Watch For in Client Contracts

## The Core Idea

Sometimes clients send you their contract instead of using yours. Read every word. Client-drafted contracts are written to protect the client, not you. Most are reasonable, but some contain clauses that are dangerous for freelancers. Know what to look for and what to push back on.

## High-Risk Red Flags

### Unlimited Revisions

**Red flag:** "Client may request revisions until satisfied."
**Why it is dangerous:** Infinite revisions means infinite work for a fixed price.
**What to negotiate:** "Include up to [X] revision rounds. Additional revisions at $[rate]/hour."

### Work-for-Hire Classification

**Red flag:** "All work shall be considered 'work made for hire.'"
**Why it is dangerous:** You lose all rights from the moment of creation. No portfolio rights, no leverage on payment.
**What to negotiate:** Assignment on final payment with retained portfolio rights.

### Broad Non-Compete

**Red flag:** "Freelancer agrees not to work with competing businesses for [12-24] months."
**Why it is dangerous:** Can prevent you from working with a significant portion of potential clients.
**What to negotiate:** Narrow the scope (specific competitors only) and duration (3-6 months max, if at all).

### No Kill Fee / No Termination Pay

**Red flag:** "Either party may terminate at any time without penalty."
**Why it is dangerous:** Client can cancel mid-project and owe you nothing for work in progress.
**What to negotiate:** "On termination, Client pays for all work completed to date plus a [25-50%] kill fee on remaining scope."

### Net 60 or Net 90 Payment Terms

**Red flag:** "Payment is due 60/90 days after invoice."
**Why it is dangerous:** You are financing the client's project for 2-3 months.
**What to negotiate:** Net 15 or Net 30 maximum. Or require a larger upfront deposit.

### Unlimited Liability

**Red flag:** No limitation of liability clause, or a clause that makes you liable for consequential damages.
**Why it is dangerous:** You could be on the hook for far more than the project fee.
**What to negotiate:** "Liability is limited to the total fees paid under this agreement."

## Medium-Risk Red Flags

### Vague Scope with Fixed Price

**Red flag:** Broad project description with a fixed fee, no attached SOW.
**Why it is dangerous:** Client can argue anything is "within scope."
**What to counter:** Require a detailed SOW as an exhibit to the contract.

### Auto-Renewal Clauses

**Red flag:** "This agreement automatically renews for successive [12-month] periods."
**Why it is dangerous:** You might be locked into unfavorable terms.
**What to negotiate:** Add a notice period for non-renewal (30-60 days).

### Broad IP Assignment

**Red flag:** "Freelancer assigns all intellectual property created during the term of this agreement."
**Why it is dangerous:** Could include work on other projects, personal tools, or ideas.
**What to negotiate:** Limit assignment to deliverables described in the SOW only.

### Mandatory Arbitration in Client's Jurisdiction

**Red flag:** "Disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration in [distant city]."
**Why it is dangerous:** Makes it expensive and impractical to pursue a claim.
**What to negotiate:** Arbitration in your jurisdiction, or at least a neutral location.

## Low-Risk But Worth Noting

### NDA That Is Too Broad

If the NDA prevents you from mentioning you worked with the client at all, negotiate portfolio rights.

### Payment Only After Client Approval

"Payment is due after Client approves all deliverables." This gives the client unlimited ability to delay payment by withholding approval. Add a deemed-approval clause: "If Client does not respond within [10] business days, deliverables are deemed approved."

### Assignment of the Contract

"Client may assign this agreement to a third party." You agreed to work with this client, not an unknown third party. Add: "Neither party may assign this agreement without the other party's written consent."

## What to Do When You See Red Flags

1. **Do not panic.** Most clients are not trying to exploit you. Their legal team wrote a client-favorable template.
2. **Mark up the contract.** Use redline/track changes to propose your modifications.
3. **Explain your reasoning.** "I would like to adjust this clause to [X] because [reason]. This protects both of us."
4. **Use your own contract when possible.** It is always better to start from your template. See `templates/contract-template.md`.
5. **Walk away if they will not negotiate.** A client who refuses all contract modifications is telling you how the working relationship will go.
