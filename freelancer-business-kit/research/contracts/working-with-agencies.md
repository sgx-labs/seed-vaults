# Working with Agencies as a Freelancer

## The Core Idea

Agencies can be a reliable source of work for freelancers. They handle client acquisition and project management while you do the work. The trade-off is a lower rate than direct clients, but the consistency and reduced sales effort can make it worthwhile — especially when building your business.

## The Agency-Freelancer Relationship

### How It Works

1. Agency wins a client project
2. Agency subcontracts specific work to you
3. You deliver to the agency, they deliver to the client
4. Agency pays you (not the end client)

### Rate Expectations

Agency rates are typically 50-70% of your direct client rate. This sounds like a big discount, but consider what you are NOT doing:
- No client acquisition
- No proposal writing
- No scope management (usually)
- No invoicing the end client
- No chasing payments

If your direct rate is $150/hour, an agency rate of $90-$100/hour can be reasonable given the reduced overhead.

### Types of Agency Relationships

**Project-Based:** One-off projects as they come up. No commitment, no guarantee of continuity.

**Preferred Vendor:** You are on the agency's shortlist. They send work your way regularly but with no formal commitment.

**Retainer/Embedded:** You work a set number of hours per week/month with the agency. Most predictable income, closest to a "job" without being one.

## Protecting Yourself

### Get a Written Agreement

Even with agencies, use a contract. Key clauses:
- Payment terms (Net 15-30, not tied to when the agency gets paid by their client)
- Scope of work for each project
- IP ownership (clarify the chain: your work to agency, agency to client)
- Non-solicitation (they cannot hire your subcontractors, you cannot poach their client)
- Portfolio rights (can you show the work? Under whose name?)

### Payment Terms Matter

**Red flag:** "We pay you when the client pays us." This is a back-to-back payment clause and it transfers the agency's credit risk to you. Push for fixed payment terms (Net 15 or Net 30 from invoice date) regardless of when the agency collects.

### Scope Clarity

Agencies can be as prone to scope creep as direct clients. Get a clear brief for each project. If the scope changes, communicate the impact in hours and cost immediately.

## The Non-Solicitation Question

Most agency contracts include a non-solicitation clause preventing you from working directly with their clients. This is reasonable — they invested in winning the client. Typical terms:

- Duration: 12-24 months after last project
- Scope: The specific client(s) you worked with
- What it covers: You cannot solicit the client. If the client approaches you independently, that is a grey area (get legal advice).

**Negotiation tip:** Push for a narrower scope (specific individuals, not the entire company) and shorter duration (12 months, not 24).

## Building Agency Relationships

### How to Get on Their Radar

1. Attend agency-frequented events and communities
2. Ask your network for introductions
3. Cold outreach to agencies in your specialty (brief, portfolio-focused)
4. Deliver exceptional work — agencies value reliability above all

### What Agencies Value Most

1. **Reliability** — Deliver on time, every time
2. **Communication** — Proactive updates, no surprises
3. **Self-management** — Do not need hand-holding
4. **Quality** — Consistent output the agency can put their name on
5. **Flexibility** — Can ramp up/down as needed

### The Graduation Path

Use agency work strategically:
- Build skills and a portfolio
- Learn how professional projects are managed
- Develop industry connections
- Generate consistent income while building direct client channels
- Eventually, reduce agency dependency as direct clients increase

## When to Say No to Agency Work

- The rate is below your minimum
- The payment terms are unreasonable (Net 60+, back-to-back)
- The scope is vague and there is no willingness to define it
- The work does not align with your positioning
- You are already at capacity with higher-paying direct clients
