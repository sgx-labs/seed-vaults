# Creating Productized Services — From Custom Work to Scalable Offers

## The Core Idea

A productized service takes work you do repeatedly and packages it as a standardized offering with a fixed scope and fixed price. Instead of custom proposals for every lead, you have a defined package that clients can buy. This reduces your sales cycle, increases your margins, and creates a path to scaling beyond your own hours.

## Examples by Profession

### Developers
- "Landing Page in 5 Days" — $3,000
- "Weekly Code Review and Security Audit" — $1,200/month
- "No-Code MVP Build" — $7,000
- "Performance Optimization Sprint" — $2,500 (one week)
- "API Integration Package" — $4,000

### Designers
- "Brand Identity Package" — $5,000 (logo, colors, typography, guidelines)
- "Website Redesign Sprint" — $8,000 (2 weeks, defined deliverables)
- "Monthly Social Media Design" — $1,500/month (X posts, X stories)
- "Pitch Deck Design" — $2,000 (up to 15 slides)

### Consultants
- "Quarterly Technology Audit" — $5,000
- "90-Minute Strategy Session" — $500
- "Monthly Advisory Retainer" — $3,000/month (2 calls + async access)
- "Hiring Process Assessment" — $2,500

## How to Build a Productized Service

### Step 1: Identify Repeatable Work

Look at your last 10 projects. What patterns do you see?
- What services do you deliver most often?
- What scope is similar across projects?
- Where do you have the most refined process?

### Step 2: Define the Fixed Scope

Write down exactly what is included and what is not:
- Specific deliverables
- Number of revisions
- Timeline
- What the client provides
- Explicit exclusions

### Step 3: Set the Price

Price based on value, not hours:
- What does this outcome typically cost through custom work?
- What is the value to the client?
- What would make this an easy "yes" while being profitable for you?

Test the price. If every lead says yes, raise it. If no one buys, lower it or redefine the scope.

### Step 4: Create the Sales Page

One page with:
- The problem this service solves
- What is included (specific deliverables)
- Timeline
- Price
- Client testimonials or results
- A clear call to action (book a call, buy now)

### Step 5: Systematize Delivery

Create a repeatable process:
- Standardized onboarding questionnaire
- Templated project structure
- Checklist for quality assurance
- Automated invoicing and scheduling

The more systematized, the faster you deliver and the higher your effective rate.

## The Scaling Path

### Level 1: You Do Everything
You deliver every productized service personally. Your efficiency increases over time, raising your effective rate.

### Level 2: You Plus Templates and Automation
Templates, scripts, and automation handle the repetitive parts. You focus on the skilled work.

### Level 3: You Plus Subcontractors
You handle client relationships and quality control. Subcontractors handle delivery. Your margin is the difference between what you charge and what you pay them.

### Level 4: It Runs Without You
The service has a team, processes, and a sales pipeline. You manage the business, not the delivery. This is no longer freelancing — it is a small agency.

## Pricing Strategy

### The Launch Price

Start 20-30% below your target price to attract early clients and build testimonials. Increase to full price after 5-10 clients.

### The Anchor Effect

If your custom work costs $10,000, a productized package at $5,000-$7,000 feels like a deal. The productized service positions your custom work as the premium option.

### Package Tiers

Offer 2-3 tiers when it makes sense:

| Tier | Example | Price |
|------|---------|-------|
| Starter | Landing page, 1 revision | $2,000 |
| Standard | Landing page + 3 inner pages, 2 revisions | $4,000 |
| Premium | Full site, 3 revisions, 30-day support | $7,000 |

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too much scope** — Keep it tight. You can always upsell.
2. **Too much customization** — If every delivery is different, it is not productized.
3. **Underpricing** — Price on value, not cost. Your efficiency is your margin.
4. **No sales page** — If it is not easy to find and understand, no one will buy it.
5. **Not tracking metrics** — Know your close rate, delivery time, and profit margin per package.
