# Finding Clients — Where Premium Work Comes From

## The Core Idea

The best freelancers rarely apply for work. Work comes to them through referrals, reputation, and inbound marketing. But that takes time to build. In the meantime, you need a proactive acquisition strategy. The mix of channels changes as your career matures — from platforms and cold outreach early on, to referrals and inbound later.

## Client Acquisition Channels

### Tier 1: Highest Quality (Invest Here Long-Term)

**Referrals from Past Clients**
The highest-converting channel. A happy client who recommends you to a colleague has already done the selling. Your close rate on referred leads should be 50-70%.

How to get more referrals:
- Do exceptional work (table stakes)
- Ask directly: "Do you know anyone else who could use similar help?"
- Make it easy: "Feel free to share my info. Here is a one-pager about what I do."
- Follow up 3-6 months after project completion

**Your Professional Network**
Former colleagues, industry contacts, people you meet at events. Let them know what you do and who your ideal client is.

How to activate your network:
- Post on LinkedIn about your work (case studies, insights, lessons)
- Attend industry meetups and conferences
- Join relevant online communities
- Be helpful without expecting immediate returns

**Inbound Content**
Blog posts, tutorials, social media content, and open-source contributions that demonstrate your expertise. Takes 6-12 months to generate leads, but the quality is high.

### Tier 2: Good for Starting Out

**Freelance Platforms (Upwork, Toptal, Contra)**
Good for building a track record and initial social proof. The goal is to use platforms as a stepping stone, not a permanent home. See `entities/upwork.md` for platform strategy.

**Job Boards**
- We Work Remotely
- Working Not Working
- Dribbble job board
- AngelList (now Wellfound)
- Industry-specific job boards

**Cold Outreach**
Identify companies that could benefit from your skills. Send personalized messages that demonstrate you understand their business. Success rate is low (1-3%) but can work if you are targeted.

### Tier 3: Supplemental

**Agency Partnerships**
Agencies often need specialists for overflow work. Position yourself as their go-to person for your specialty. The rate is usually lower than direct clients, but the volume can be consistent.

**Subcontracting**
Other freelancers who are overloaded may subcontract work to you. Build relationships with freelancers who serve the same market but offer different services.

## The Outreach Framework

When reaching out to a potential client:

1. **Research them first** — Understand their business, recent challenges, or growth
2. **Lead with value** — Reference something specific about their business
3. **Be concise** — 3-5 sentences maximum
4. **Include proof** — Link to a relevant case study
5. **Make the ask small** — "Would a 15-minute call be useful?" not "Can I send you a proposal?"

## Building a Client Pipeline

### The Numbers

For a healthy pipeline:
- **5-10 leads** at any time (people you are talking to)
- **2-3 proposals** out at any time
- **1-2 active projects** at any time

If your pipeline drops below 5 leads, increase your acquisition efforts immediately. The gap between "stop marketing" and "need a client" is usually 4-8 weeks.

### Weekly Acquisition Habit

Dedicate 2-4 hours per week to business development:
- Reach out to 3-5 potential leads
- Follow up on existing conversations
- Post one piece of content
- Ask one past client for a referral

Do this consistently, even when you are busy. Especially when you are busy. The pipeline feeds your future, not your present.

## When You Are Just Starting

If you have zero clients and zero portfolio:
1. Tell everyone you know you are freelancing (family, friends, former colleagues)
2. Offer a discounted "launch rate" for your first 3 clients
3. Do one project for free or at cost in exchange for a testimonial and case study
4. Join platforms and bid aggressively on well-matched projects
5. Create 2-3 portfolio pieces from personal or spec projects
