# Building Recurring Revenue — Retainers and Productized Services

## The Core Idea

Project-based freelancing is feast or famine. One month you are overloaded, the next you are hustling for new clients. Recurring revenue — retainers and productized services — smooths the income curve and gives you a predictable financial foundation. The goal is to cover your baseline expenses with recurring revenue so that project work is profit, not survival.

## Retainer Agreements

### What a Retainer Is

A client pays a fixed monthly fee for a defined amount of your time or a defined set of services. The client gets priority access and predictability. You get guaranteed income and less sales effort.

### Types of Retainers

**Time-Based:** Client buys a block of hours per month.
- Example: "10 hours per month at $150/hour = $1,500/month"
- Unused hours do not roll over (or roll over with a cap)
- Hours are tracked and reported monthly

**Deliverable-Based:** Client gets specific recurring outputs.
- Example: "4 blog posts per month, 2 social media graphics, and 1 newsletter"
- Fixed price regardless of how long it takes
- Rewards your efficiency

**Access-Based:** Client pays for priority access and availability.
- Example: "$2,000/month for priority response (within 4 hours), monthly strategy call, and up to 5 support requests"
- Highest margins because you are selling access, not hours
- Works best for experienced consultants

### How to Propose a Retainer

The best time to propose a retainer is at the end of a successful project:

"We have had great results with this project. To maintain the momentum, I offer a monthly retainer that includes [specific services]. This gives you priority access and consistent progress without the overhead of scoping individual projects. Want me to put together a proposal?"

### Retainer Pricing

- Time-based: Your hourly rate (or a slight discount for guaranteed volume)
- Deliverable-based: Your project rate divided by deliverables
- Access-based: Premium over your standard rate (clients pay for the guarantee)

### Retainer Terms

- Minimum commitment: 3 months (gives it time to prove value)
- Notice period: 30 days to cancel
- Payment: In advance, on the 1st of each month
- Scope: Clearly define what is and is not included

## Productized Services

### What a Productized Service Is

A standardized service package with a fixed scope and fixed price. The client buys it like a product. You deliver it like a process.

### Examples

- "Landing Page in 5 Days — $3,000" (defined deliverables, fixed timeline)
- "Monthly SEO Audit — $500/month" (recurring, standardized)
- "No-Code MVP — $7,000" (fixed scope, fixed price)
- "Weekly Code Review — $1,200/month" (recurring, deliverable-based)
- "Quarterly Security Audit — $5,000/quarter" (recurring, high-value)

### Why Productized Services Work

1. **Easier to sell** — The client knows exactly what they get and what it costs
2. **Easier to deliver** — You refine the process over time and get faster
3. **Higher margins** — As you systematize, your effective rate increases
4. **Easier to scale** — Standardized work can eventually be delegated
5. **Lower sales friction** — No custom proposals for every lead

### How to Create a Productized Service

1. Identify work you do repeatedly for different clients
2. Standardize the scope (what is always included, what is always excluded)
3. Set a fixed price based on your average time investment
4. Create a simple sales page or one-pager describing the offering
5. Deliver it the same way every time, refining the process

### Pricing

Price based on value to the client, not your time. If a "Landing Page in 5 Days" takes you 15 hours at $150/hour, that is $2,250 in time. But the value to the client might be $5,000-$10,000 in future revenue. Price at $3,000-$5,000.

## The Revenue Mix

Aim for a healthy balance:

| Revenue Type | Target Percentage | Purpose |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Retainers | 40-60% | Baseline stability |
| Project work | 20-40% | Growth and variety |
| Productized | 10-20% | Scalable income |

When retainers cover your baseline expenses (rent, insurance, taxes), project work becomes profit rather than survival income.

## Getting Started

1. Identify your 2-3 most consistent clients
2. Propose a retainer to your best one
3. Package one thing you do repeatedly as a productized service
4. Track the revenue mix and adjust over time
5. Aim to add one new retainer per quarter

Only 13% of consultants use monthly retainers. Being in that 13% gives you a significant stability advantage.
