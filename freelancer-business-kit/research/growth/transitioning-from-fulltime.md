# Transitioning from Full-Time Employment to Freelancing

## The Core Idea

The best transitions are gradual, not dramatic. Quitting your job on a Friday and starting freelancing on Monday is a fantasy that rarely works out well. The freelancers who succeed plan their exit, build a client base before leaving, and have a financial runway that buys them time to figure things out without panic.

## Before You Quit — The Preparation Phase

### Financial Runway

Save 3-6 months of living expenses. This is non-negotiable. Your first few months of freelancing will be unpredictable. You need a buffer that lets you make good decisions instead of desperate ones.

Calculate your bare minimum monthly expenses:
- Rent/mortgage
- Food
- Insurance (you will need to buy your own health insurance)
- Utilities
- Debt payments
- Minimum savings

Multiply by 6. That is your runway target.

### Start Freelancing on the Side

Do not wait until you quit to start finding clients. Take on 1-2 side projects while still employed. This teaches you:
- How to find clients
- How to price your work
- How to manage client relationships
- Whether you actually enjoy freelancing

**Important:** Check your employment agreement for moonlighting restrictions, non-compete clauses, and IP assignment provisions.

### Build Your Foundation

Before leaving, have these ready:
- A portfolio (even 2-3 pieces)
- A basic website or online presence
- A contract template
- An invoicing system
- A business bank account
- Health insurance plan identified (COBRA, marketplace, or spouse's plan)

### Line Up Your First Clients

The ideal scenario: leave your job with at least one paying client already in place. The best way to get that first client is through your network. Let people know you are going freelance (after you have given notice).

## The Transition Timeline

### 6 Months Before Quitting

- Start saving aggressively
- Take on your first side project
- Research health insurance options
- Build your portfolio

### 3 Months Before Quitting

- Have 2-3 side clients or strong leads
- File for an LLC if you have decided on that structure
- Open a business bank account
- Set up invoicing software

### 1 Month Before Quitting

- Give notice at your job
- Tell your network you are going freelance
- Transition side clients to full-time attention after your last day
- Apply for health insurance

### First 90 Days of Freelancing

- Focus on client acquisition (this is job #1)
- Deliver exceptional work on every project (reputation is everything early on)
- Network aggressively (coffees, events, online communities)
- Set up your tax payment system (quarterly estimates)
- Track everything (time, expenses, income, leads)

## The Overnight Transition (When You Cannot Wait)

If you are laid off, fired, or simply cannot wait:

1. **Apply for unemployment** if eligible (freelancing while collecting UI has rules — check your state)
2. **Sign up for health insurance** within 60 days (qualifying life event)
3. **Cut expenses to the bone** until income stabilizes
4. **Tell everyone** you are available for freelance work — your network is your lifeline
5. **Accept a variety of work** initially, even if it is not your ideal project
6. **Set a 90-day checkpoint** — if things are not working, have a backup plan

## Common Transition Mistakes

1. **Quitting too early** — Before you have clients, runway, or insurance
2. **Underpricing to get clients** — Desperation pricing sets expectations you will regret
3. **Not treating it like a business** — Track finances, pay taxes, sign contracts from day one
4. **Isolation** — You are used to having coworkers. Find a community (coworking, online groups, meetups)
5. **Working 24/7** — Burnout in the first 6 months kills more freelance careers than lack of clients
6. **Ignoring the business side** — Doing great work is necessary but not sufficient. Sales, marketing, and admin are part of the job

## The Decision Framework

You are ready to go full-time freelance when:
- You have 3-6 months of expenses saved
- You have at least one paying client (ideally 2-3)
- You have health insurance figured out
- You have the basic business infrastructure in place
- You are consistently earning at least 50% of your target income from freelance work
- You are willing to hustle for the first 6-12 months
