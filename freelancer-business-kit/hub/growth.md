# Business Growth

## Overview

Growth for freelancers is not about scaling headcount. It is about increasing revenue per hour, building predictable income, and attracting better clients. The path goes from feast-or-famine project work to stable retainers and productized services. Marketing is not a dirty word — it is how good clients find you.

## Key Principles

1. **Referrals are earned, not asked for.** Do great work and make it easy for clients to recommend you.
2. **Your portfolio is your sales team.** Invest in case studies that show results, not just deliverables.
3. **Recurring revenue beats project work.** One retainer client is worth five one-off projects.
4. **Raise your rates regularly.** If no one is saying no, you are underpriced.
