# Business Growth

## Overview

Freelance business growth means increasing revenue per hour, building predictable recurring income, and attracting premium clients. This hub covers finding clients through referrals, networking, and content marketing, building a portfolio with case studies and measurable results, creating productized services and retainer agreements for stable monthly revenue, transitioning from full-time employment to freelancing, personal branding and positioning to stand out in your niche, and raising your profile through LinkedIn, speaking, and community engagement. The progression from feast-or-famine project work to predictable retainer revenue is the path to a sustainable freelance career.

## Key Principles

1. **Referrals are earned, not asked for.** Do great work and make it easy for clients to recommend you.
2. **Your portfolio is your sales team.** Invest in case studies that show results, not just deliverables.
3. **Recurring revenue beats project work.** One retainer client is worth five one-off projects.
4. **Raise your rates regularly.** If no one is saying no, you are underpriced.
