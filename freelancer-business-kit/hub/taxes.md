# Taxes and Business Structure

## Overview

Taxes are the part of freelancing nobody talks about until April. The basics: you owe income tax plus self-employment tax (15.3%), you pay quarterly (not annually), and your business entity structure affects how much you pay. Getting this right from the start saves thousands of dollars and prevents nasty surprises.

## Key Principles

1. **Set aside 25-30% of every payment.** Into a separate account, immediately. Non-negotiable.
2. **Pay quarterly.** Missing quarterly estimates triggers penalties.
3. **Track every deduction.** Home office, software, hardware, travel, meals — it adds up.
4. **Get a CPA.** The cost of a good accountant pays for itself many times over.
