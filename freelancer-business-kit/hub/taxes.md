# Taxes and Business Structure

## Overview

Freelancer tax obligations and business entity structure are the financial backbone of your independent practice. This hub covers self-employment tax (15.3%), quarterly estimated tax payments and IRS deadlines, common tax deductions including home office and health insurance, choosing between sole proprietorship, LLC, and S-Corp election, retirement planning with SEP-IRA and Solo 401(k), the 25-30% set-aside rule for every payment, and when to hire a CPA. Proper tax planning from day one saves thousands of dollars annually and prevents costly penalties and audit surprises.

## Key Principles

1. **Set aside 25-30% of every payment.** Into a separate account, immediately. Non-negotiable.
2. **Pay quarterly.** Missing quarterly estimates triggers penalties.
3. **Track every deduction.** Home office, software, hardware, travel, meals — it adds up.
4. **Get a CPA.** The cost of a good accountant pays for itself many times over.
