# Proposals and Pricing

## Overview

Proposals and pricing strategy determine your freelance income. This hub covers writing winning project proposals, calculating your freelance hourly rate, choosing between hourly, project-based, and value-based pricing models, negotiating rates without losing deals, writing clear scopes of work (SOW) with exclusions and revision limits, knowing when and how to raise your rates, and handling revisions and feedback loops. Master these skills to close more projects at higher margins and build predictable revenue.

## Key Principles

1. **Lead with the problem, not your skills.** The client cares about their problem being solved.
2. **Be specific about deliverables.** Vague scope is where projects go sideways.
3. **Price the value, not the hours.** As you gain experience, move from hourly to project to value-based.
4. **Include what is NOT included.** Exclusions prevent scope creep before it starts.

## Pricing Progression

Most freelancers evolve through these stages:

1. **Hourly** — Trading time for money. Simple, transparent, but caps your income.
2. **Project-based** — Fixed fee for defined scope. Better margins if you estimate well.
3. **Value-based** — Price based on business impact. Highest margins, requires confidence.
4. **Productized** — Standardized packages at fixed prices. Scalable, predictable.
