# Proposals and Pricing

## Overview

A proposal is a sales document disguised as a project plan. The best proposals demonstrate understanding of the client's problem, outline a clear solution, set expectations, and make saying "yes" easy. Pricing is the other half of the equation — charge too little and you resent the work; charge too much without justification and you lose the deal.

## Key Principles

1. **Lead with the problem, not your skills.** The client cares about their problem being solved.
2. **Be specific about deliverables.** Vague scope is where projects go sideways.
3. **Price the value, not the hours.** As you gain experience, move from hourly to project to value-based.
4. **Include what is NOT included.** Exclusions prevent scope creep before it starts.

## Pricing Progression

Most freelancers evolve through these stages:

1. **Hourly** — Trading time for money. Simple, transparent, but caps your income.
2. **Project-based** — Fixed fee for defined scope. Better margins if you estimate well.
3. **Value-based** — Price based on business impact. Highest margins, requires confidence.
4. **Productized** — Standardized packages at fixed prices. Scalable, predictable.
