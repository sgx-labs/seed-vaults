# Client Management

## Overview

Client management is the core discipline of freelancing. This hub covers the complete client lifecycle for freelancers: finding and evaluating prospective clients, professional onboarding with contracts and kickoff calls, setting communication boundaries and expectations, managing multiple active projects without dropping deadlines, getting testimonials and case studies for your portfolio, and knowing when and how to fire a bad client. Effective client relationships drive referrals, repeat business, and sustainable revenue growth.

## Key Principles

1. **Qualify before you commit.** Evaluate every potential client against red flags before signing.
2. **Set expectations early.** The onboarding process sets the tone for the entire relationship.
3. **Document everything.** Every agreement, scope change, and decision goes in writing.
4. **Fire fast.** A bad client costs more than no client. Your time has an opportunity cost.
