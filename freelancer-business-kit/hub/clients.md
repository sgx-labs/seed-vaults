# Client Management

## Overview

Clients are the lifeblood of your freelance business, but not all clients are equal. The best freelancers are selective about who they work with, have clear communication systems, and know when to walk away. This hub covers the full client lifecycle: finding, evaluating, onboarding, managing, and (when necessary) ending relationships.

## Key Principles

1. **Qualify before you commit.** Evaluate every potential client against red flags before signing.
2. **Set expectations early.** The onboarding process sets the tone for the entire relationship.
3. **Document everything.** Every agreement, scope change, and decision goes in writing.
4. **Fire fast.** A bad client costs more than no client. Your time has an opportunity cost.

## Client Note Template

When you onboard a new client, create a note:

```markdown
---
title: "Client: [Company Name]"
tags: [client, active]
content_type: entity
domain: business
---

# [Company Name]

- **Contact:** [Name, email]
- **Rate:** [$/hr or project fee]
- **Payment terms:** [Net 15, Net 30, etc.]
- **Contract signed:** [Date]
