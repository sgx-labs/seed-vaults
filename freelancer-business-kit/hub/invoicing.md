# Invoicing and Payments

## Overview

Getting paid is not automatic. You need systems: clear invoices, consistent follow-up, and procedures for when clients are late. The goal is to make paying you the easiest thing on your client's to-do list while having a firm escalation process for when they don't.

## Key Principles

1. **Invoice immediately.** Send invoices the same day work is delivered or a milestone is hit.
2. **Make paying easy.** Accept multiple payment methods. Include a direct payment link.
3. **Net 15 over Net 30.** Shorter payment terms mean faster cash flow. Net 30 is the client's preference, not yours.
4. **Late fees are not optional.** Include them in your contract and enforce them consistently.

| Net 30 | Due 30 days after invoice | Enterprise clients who insist |
| 50/50 | 50% upfront, 50% on delivery | Projects under $5,000 |

| Retainer | Monthly pre-payment | Ongoing relationships |

## Late Payment Escalation

1. **Day 1 past due:** Friendly reminder email
2. **Day 7:** Firmer follow-up with late fee notice
3. **Day 14:** Phone call + formal written notice
4. **Day 30:** Pause all work, send final demand
5. **Day 60:** Collections or small claims consideration
