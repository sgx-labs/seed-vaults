# Invoicing and Payments

## Overview

Invoicing and payment collection are critical freelance business operations that directly affect cash flow and financial stability. This hub covers invoice formatting best practices, payment terms (Net 15 vs Net 30), handling late payments with a documented escalation procedure from friendly reminders to collections, choosing invoicing tools like FreshBooks and Stripe, managing cash flow with the three-account system, setting up milestone-based billing and retainer invoicing, and enforcing late fees consistently. Systematic invoicing prevents the cash flow crises that sink freelance businesses.

## Key Principles

1. **Invoice immediately.** Send invoices the same day work is delivered or a milestone is hit.
2. **Make paying easy.** Accept multiple payment methods. Include a direct payment link.
3. **Net 15 over Net 30.** Shorter payment terms mean faster cash flow. Net 30 is the client's preference, not yours.
4. **Late fees are not optional.** Include them in your contract and enforce them consistently.

## Late Payment Escalation

1. **Day 1 past due:** Friendly reminder email
2. **Day 7:** Firmer follow-up with late fee notice
3. **Day 14:** Phone call + formal written notice
4. **Day 30:** Pause all work, send final demand
5. **Day 60:** Collections or small claims consideration
