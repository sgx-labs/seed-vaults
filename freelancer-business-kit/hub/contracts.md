# Contracts and Legal

## Overview

A contract is the single most important document in your freelance business. It protects your work, guarantees payment, and defines the relationship. Working without a contract is working without a safety net. Every project, no matter how small, deserves a written agreement.

## Key Principles

1. **Never start work without a signed contract.** No exceptions, not even for friends.
2. **Your contract protects both parties.** Frame it that way to clients who resist signing.
3. **Keep IP until paid.** Intellectual property transfers on final payment, not before.
4. **Include a kill fee.** If the client cancels mid-project, you should be compensated for work done.

|-------|------|
| Essential contract clauses | `research/contracts/essential-clauses.md` |
| Handling scope creep | `research/contracts/handling-scope-creep.md` |
| IP and ownership language | `research/contracts/ip-ownership.md` |
| Contract red flags | `research/contracts/contract-red-flags.md` |

## The Non-Negotiable Clauses

Every freelance contract should include at minimum:

1. **Scope of work** — What you will deliver
2. **Payment terms** — How much, when, and late fees
3. **Timeline** — Start date, milestones, delivery date
4. **Revision limits** — How many rounds, what counts as a revision
5. **IP transfer** — When ownership transfers (on final payment)
6. **Termination** — How either party can end the agreement
7. **Confidentiality** — Mutual NDA terms
8. **Liability cap** — Your maximum exposure
