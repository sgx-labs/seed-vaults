# Contracts and Legal

## Overview

Contracts and legal protection form the foundation of a sustainable freelance practice. This hub covers essential contract clauses every freelancer needs, intellectual property ownership and assignment language, handling scope creep with change orders, spotting red flags in client-drafted contracts, working with agencies as a subcontractor, and freelancer insurance options including professional liability and E&O coverage. Never start a project without a signed written agreement that protects your income, your IP, and your sanity.

## Key Principles

1. **Never start work without a signed contract.** No exceptions, not even for friends.
2. **Your contract protects both parties.** Frame it that way to clients who resist signing.
3. **Keep IP until paid.** Intellectual property transfers on final payment, not before.
4. **Include a kill fee.** If the client cancels mid-project, you should be compensated for work done.

## The Non-Negotiable Clauses

Every freelance contract should include at minimum:

1. **Scope of work** — What you will deliver
2. **Payment terms** — How much, when, and late fees
3. **Timeline** — Start date, milestones, delivery date
4. **Revision limits** — How many rounds, what counts as a revision
5. **IP transfer** — When ownership transfers (on final payment)
6. **Termination** — How either party can end the agreement
7. **Confidentiality** — Mutual NDA terms
8. **Liability cap** — Your maximum exposure
