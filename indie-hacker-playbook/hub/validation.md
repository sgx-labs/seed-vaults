# Validation — Test Before You Build

## Why This Matters

Most indie projects fail because the founder built something nobody wanted. Validation is the process of proving demand before writing code. It saves months of wasted effort. The goal is to get signal — positive or negative — as fast as possible.

## The Validation Stack

| Method | Cost | Time | Signal quality |
|--------|------|------|---------------|
| Talk to people (Mom Test) | Free | 1 week | High |
| Landing page test | $20-50 | 1 week | Medium-High |
| Preselling | $0-50 | 2 weeks | Highest |
| Competitor analysis | Free | 2 hours | Medium |
| Community lurking | Free | Ongoing | Medium |

## Quick Decision Tree

1. **Can you describe the problem in one sentence?** If no, keep refining.
2. **Are people already paying for solutions?** If no, be cautious — you may be creating a market.
3. **Can you reach these people?** If no, distribution will kill you.
4. **Would you use this yourself?** Scratch-your-own-itch products have higher success rates.

## Key Principle

> "If you can't find 10 people who will pay for it, you don't have a business — you have a hobby." Validation is not about confirming your idea is good. It is about finding out if it is bad before you invest months building it.
