# Growth — From Launch to Revenue

**Overview.** Sustainable growth for indie hackers comes from repeatable, compounding distribution channels. This hub covers getting your first 10 paying customers through manual outreach, SEO and content marketing for organic traffic, building in public on Twitter/X, email list building and newsletter strategy, the path from zero to one thousand dollars MRR, and tracking the metrics that actually matter for early-stage products. Each research note maps a specific growth tactic with realistic timelines and conversion expectations.

## Why This Matters

Launch spikes fade. Sustainable growth comes from repeatable channels — SEO, content, community, word of mouth. As a solo founder, you need channels that compound over time, not ones that require constant attention.

## Growth Channels for Indie Hackers

| Channel | Time to results | Effort to maintain | Compounds? |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| SEO / blog content | 3-6 months | Medium | Yes |
| Build in public (X) | 1-3 months | Medium | Yes |
| Community engagement | 2-4 weeks | Medium | Somewhat |
| Product Hunt relaunches | Immediate | High | No |
| Email newsletter | 1-3 months | Low-Medium | Yes |
| Word of mouth | Variable | None (if product is good) | Yes |
| Paid ads | Immediate | High (cost) | No |

## The Growth Hierarchy

1. **First 10 customers** — Manual outreach, direct conversations
2. **10-100 customers** — Community presence, content, referrals
3. **100-1000 customers** — SEO, partnerships, building in public
4. **1000+ customers** — Word of mouth, brand, paid channels

> "You don't need 1,000 users — you need 10 who love it." Focus on making existing users successful before chasing new ones. Happy users are your best marketing channel.
