# Operations — Running a One-Person Business

**Overview.** Solo founder operations cover everything that keeps a one-person business running sustainably over years, not just months. This hub addresses time management for the two-hour founder with a day job, burnout prevention strategies, handling customer support alone, legal basics including LLC formation and terms of service and privacy policies, simple analytics setup without complexity, when to pivot or persevere, and the common mistakes that kill indie hacker projects before they reach revenue.

## Why This Matters

Solo founding is a marathon, not a sprint. The number one killer of indie projects is not competition or bad ideas — it is burnout. Operations is about building sustainable systems so you can keep going for years, not just months.

## The Solo Founder Stack

| Function | Tool category | Keep it simple |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Support | Email + help docs | Crisp, Intercom, or just email |
| Analytics | One dashboard | Plausible, PostHog, or Vercel Analytics |
| Error tracking | Crash reports | Sentry free tier |
| Billing | Payment processor | Stripe or Lemon Squeezy |
| Legal | Templates | Termly, or hire a lawyer once |
| Email | Transactional + marketing | Resend + Buttondown |
| Hosting | Platform | Vercel, Railway, or Fly.io |

## The 2-Hour Founder Schedule

If you have a day job, you have roughly 2 focused hours per day. Protect them.

| Day | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| Mon-Wed | Build (code, ship features) |
| Thu | Market (content, community, outreach) |
| Fri | Admin (support, bugs, metrics review) |
| Sat-Sun | Optional: deep work or rest |

## Key Principle

> "Sustainability beats intensity." Working 16-hour days for 2 months then quitting is worse than working 2 focused hours daily for 2 years. Build systems, not heroics.
