# Launching — Get It In Front of People

## Why This Matters

A launch is not a one-time event. It is a series of moments where you put your product in front of new audiences. Most indie hackers launch once and wonder why nobody came. The best ones launch continuously across multiple channels.

## Launch Channels Ranked

| Channel | Effort | Reach | Best for |
|---------|--------|-------|----------|
| Product Hunt | High | High (one-day spike) | Dev tools, SaaS, design tools |
| Show HN | Medium | High (if it hits) | Technical tools, open source |
| Reddit | Medium | Medium | Niche communities |
| Twitter/X | Low-Medium | Variable | Developer audience |
| Indie Hackers | Low | Medium | Bootstrapper audience |
| Personal network | Low | Low | Early feedback |

## Launch Timeline

1. **2 weeks before:** Prepare assets, build email list, engage communities
2. **1 week before:** Line up supporters, finalize landing page, set up analytics
3. **Launch day:** Post everywhere, respond to every comment, be available all day
4. **1 week after:** Follow up with signups, send thank-you notes, fix reported bugs
5. **Ongoing:** Relaunch on new channels every 2-4 weeks

## Key Principle

> "Launch early, launch often." Your first launch will not be your biggest. Treat every new feature, integration, or milestone as a reason to launch again.
