# Building — Ship Your MVP Fast

## Why This Matters

The MVP is the smallest thing you can ship that tests your core assumption. Not a prototype. Not a demo. A real product that solves one problem for one type of person. The goal is speed — get it in front of users in weeks, not months.

## The MVP Spectrum

| Approach | Time | When to use |
|----------|------|-------------|
| No-code (Carrd + Gumroad) | 1 day | Info products, simple tools |
| Low-code (Bubble, Softr) | 1-2 weeks | CRUD apps, directories |
| Boilerplate (ShipFast, Supastarter) | 1-2 weeks | SaaS with auth/payments |
| Custom code | 2-6 weeks | Complex logic, API-heavy |

## What to Build vs. What to Skip

**Build:** The core value proposition — the one thing that makes someone pay.

**Skip for now:** User profiles, admin dashboards, email notifications, analytics, multi-tenancy, mobile app, perfect design, onboarding flows, team features.

## Research Notes

- `research/building/mvp-strategy.md` — What to build, what to fake, what to skip
- `research/building/tech-stack-speed.md` — Stack choices optimized for shipping fast
- `research/building/boilerplate-starters.md` — SaaS boilerplates that save weeks
- `research/building/design-for-devs.md` — Ship good-looking products without a designer
- `research/building/ai-assisted-building.md` — Using AI coding tools to ship faster
- `research/building/database-choices.md` — Pick a database and move on

## Key Principle

> "If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you have launched too late." The MVP is a learning vehicle. Ship it, watch what people do, then iterate based on real behavior.
