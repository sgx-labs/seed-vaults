# Pricing — Charge What You're Worth

## Why This Matters

Pricing is the single biggest lever for revenue. Most indie hackers undercharge. Doubling your price loses fewer customers than you think and doubles your revenue. Getting pricing right early prevents the painful "our users expect it to be free" trap.

## The Indie Hacker Pricing Playbook

| Price point | Best for | Example |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| $9/mo | Simple tools, personal use | Utility apps, browser extensions |
| $29/mo | Professional tools, saves time | SaaS for freelancers |
| $49-99/mo | Business tools, saves money | SaaS for small teams |
| $199+/mo | Enterprise pain, replaces staff | Specialized B2B tools |
| One-time $49-199 | Developer tools, boilerplates | Code templates, CLI tools |

## Common Pricing Mistakes

1. **Starting free** — Free users rarely convert. Charge from day one.
2. **Only one tier** — Anchoring requires at least 2-3 options.
3. **Pricing by cost** — Price by value delivered, not by your costs.
4. **Hiding the price** — Transparent pricing builds trust.
5. **No annual discount** — Offer 2 months free for annual billing.

## Key Principle

> "The pain is the price multiplier." The deeper the pain you solve, the more you can charge. A tool that saves someone $500/mo is worth $50/mo easily. Price based on the value gap, not your imposter syndrome.
