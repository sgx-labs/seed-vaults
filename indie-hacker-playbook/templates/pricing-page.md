## Pricing Psychology Principles

1. **Anchor high.** The expensive tier makes the middle tier look reasonable.
2. **Highlight the middle.** "Most Popular" badge + larger button drives selection.
3. **Use charm pricing.** $29 feels significantly cheaper than $30.
4. **Annual discount.** 20% off (or "2 months free") incentivizes commitment.
5. **Remove friction.** "No credit card required" for trials. Money-back guarantee for paid.
6. **Show value, not features.** "Save 10 hours/week" in the tier description, not just "automated workflows."
