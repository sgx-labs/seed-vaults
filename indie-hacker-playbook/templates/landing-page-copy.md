# Landing Page Copy Template

## Above the Fold (Hero Section)

**Headline:** [Verb] + [outcome] + [without/in/for] + [constraint or audience]
- Example: "Ship your SaaS in days, not months"
- Example: "Turn customer feedback into product decisions"
- Example: "Invoice clients without the accounting headache"

**Subheadline:** One sentence expanding on HOW you deliver the headline.
- Example: "A boilerplate with auth, payments, and email built in. Just add your idea."

**CTA Button:** Action-oriented, specific.
- Good: "Start building free" / "Get started — $29/mo" / "Try it now"
- Bad: "Learn more" / "Submit" / "Click here"

**Social proof (optional):** "Used by 500+ developers" or a short testimonial

## Problem Section

**Header:** "You know the feeling..."

Write 3-4 bullet points describing the pain your audience feels. Use their words.
- "You spend more time on boilerplate than on your actual product"
- "Every project starts with the same 2 weeks of auth and payments setup"
- "You have shipped 0 projects because setup takes too long"

## Solution Section

**Header:** "There is a better way" or "What if you could..."

3-4 features, each with:
- **Feature name** — One-line description focused on the OUTCOME, not the mechanism
- Example: "Auth in 5 minutes" — Passwords, OAuth, magic links. Copy one file, done.
- Example: "Payments that just work" — Stripe subscriptions, webhooks, customer portal. Pre-wired.

## Social Proof Section

- 2-3 testimonials (name, role, company optional)
- Revenue or usage numbers if you have them
- Logos of companies/products using it (if applicable)
- "As seen on" badges (Product Hunt, HN, etc.)

## Pricing Section

Link to `templates/pricing-page.md` for full pricing structure.

Quick version: Show 2-3 tiers side by side. Highlight the middle tier.

## Final CTA Section

**Header:** Restate the core value proposition
**CTA:** Same button as hero section
**Risk reducer:** "14-day money-back guarantee" / "No credit card required" / "Cancel anytime"

## Copywriting Rules

1. **Write for scanners.** Most people do not read — they scan. Bold key phrases.
2. **Benefits over features.** "Save 10 hours/week" beats "automated workflow engine."
3. **Use their language.** Go to Reddit/Twitter where your audience hangs out. Copy their words.
4. **One CTA per section.** Do not compete with yourself.
5. **Remove every word you can.** If the sentence works without it, delete it.
