# Decision Log

## AD-001: Ship fast, iterate based on feedback

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-14

Build the smallest possible version of your product and ship it within weeks, not months. Real user feedback is worth more than months of planning. The first version should be embarrassingly simple. If you spend 6 months in stealth mode, you are likely building the wrong thing.

**Alternative considered:** Building a complete product before launching. Rejected because you cannot predict what users actually want without shipping.

## AD-002: Pick boring tech for solo projects

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-14

Use proven, well-documented technology that you already know. As a solo founder, debugging obscure framework issues at 11 PM is not a good use of your limited time. Next.js, Rails, Django, Laravel — pick what you know and ship. The tech stack almost never determines success or failure.

**Alternative considered:** Using the newest/trendiest stack. Rejected because novelty creates unknown failure modes, and as a solo founder you have no one to help debug.

## AD-003: Build distribution before product

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-14

Start building an audience before you have a product. Share what you are learning, document your journey, engage in communities where your potential customers hang out. When you launch, you have people who already care. An audience of 500 engaged followers is worth more than a perfect product with zero distribution.

**Alternative considered:** Build first, market later. Rejected because the "if you build it they will come" myth has killed more indie projects than bad code.

## AD-004: Charge from day one

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2026-02-14

Put a price on your product from the first version. Free users do not validate willingness to pay. A single paying customer teaches you more than 1,000 free signups. Charging also filters for serious users who will give you better feedback. You can always offer a trial period, but never make "free forever" the default.

**Alternative considered:** Launching free to build user base first. Rejected because free-to-paid conversion is one of the hardest problems in SaaS, and free users have different needs than paying customers.
