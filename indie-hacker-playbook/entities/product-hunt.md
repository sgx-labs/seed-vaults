# Product Hunt — Current State

## What It Is

Product discovery platform. Products compete for upvotes daily. Top products get visibility to a large tech-savvy audience. Acquired by some investors but remains the go-to launch platform for tech products.

## How It Works (2025-2026)

- Products launch at midnight Pacific Time
- The PH team manually curates which products appear on the homepage
- Filtering is ruthlessly selective — products are evaluated on usefulness and quality
- Daily ranking determines visibility
- You can launch multiple times (relaunch with major updates)

## Key Stats

- Average upvotes needed for #1 on Monday: ~633
- Average upvotes needed for #1 on Saturday: ~366
- Less competitive days (Sat/Sun) can still drive significant traffic

## What Changed Recently

- Homepage curation became stricter in 2025 — generic AI wrappers get filtered out
- The team emphasizes practical, useful products over novel concepts
- Coming Soon pages let you build an audience before launch
- Relaunching is encouraged for major updates

## Optimal Launch Strategy

1. Create a Coming Soon page 2-4 weeks before launch
2. Engage with the community (upvote, comment on other products)
3. Prepare: tagline, description, gallery images/GIFs, maker's comment, FAQ
4. Launch Tuesday-Thursday for maximum competition and visibility
5. Launch Saturday-Sunday for easier #1 placement
6. First comment (maker's comment) should explain WHY you built it
7. Respond to every comment on launch day
8. Follow up with everyone who signed up

## Common Mistakes

- Asking for upvotes (against guidelines, voting rings get detected)
- Sending direct links to the post (those upvotes may not count)
- Launching without community engagement beforehand
- Generic taglines that do not communicate value
- No maker's comment explaining the backstory
