# Indie Hackers — Current State

## What It Is

Online community for bootstrapped founders, side project builders, and solo entrepreneurs. Originally founded by Courtland Allen, acquired by Stripe in 2017. Still the primary gathering place for indie builders to share revenue numbers, strategies, and milestones.

## How to Use It (2025-2026)

### For Validation
- Post in the community asking about pain points in your target market
- Search for people building similar things — learn from their journey
- Read milestone posts for realistic revenue expectations

### For Launching
- Post your launch as a "Show IH" post
- The community is receptive to new products if you engage authentically
- Participate in discussions before launching (do not just show up to promote)

### For Growth
- Share milestone posts: "From $0 to $1K MRR — here's how"
- Answer questions in your domain to build authority
- Comment on other builders' posts to build relationships

## What Works on Indie Hackers

| Content type | Engagement level | Example |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| Revenue milestones | Very high | "How I grew to $5K MRR in 6 months" |
| Transparent failure posts | High | "Why I shut down my SaaS after 8 months" |
| Tactical how-to posts | High | "My exact SEO strategy for 10K monthly visitors" |
| Show IH (product launch) | Medium | "Show IH: Tool that does X for Y people" |
| Ask IH (questions) | Medium | "What payment processor do you use?" |
| Pure promotion | Low | "Check out my new product" (avoid this) |

## Key Communities (2025-2026)

Beyond Indie Hackers, the indie builder community has expanded:
- **X/Twitter** — #buildinpublic community
- **Reddit** — r/SideProject, r/SaaS, r/Entrepreneur
- **Discord** — Various indie hacker servers
- **Hacker News** — Show HN for technical audience

## Posting Strategy

1. **Engage for 2-4 weeks** before posting your own content
2. **Share real numbers** — revenue, costs, traffic. Transparency builds trust.
3. **Tell a story** — journeys outperform announcements
4. **Ask for specific feedback** — "What do you think of my pricing?" beats "check this out"
5. **Follow up** — Reply to every comment on your posts
