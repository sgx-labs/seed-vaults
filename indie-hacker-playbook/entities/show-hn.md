# Show HN — Current State

## What It Is

A section of Hacker News where builders share projects they have made. Prefix your title with "Show HN:" to appear on the dedicated Show tab. Less competitive than the main page, giving your post more time to gather upvotes.

## Rules

- You must have built or been significantly involved in what you are showing
- Link directly to the project (not a blog post about it)
- Include a description in the text body explaining what it does and why you built it
- Open source projects can link to the GitHub repo
- Do NOT ask for upvotes — HN's voting ring detection is excellent

## What Works

| Element | Good | Bad |
|---------|------|-----|
| Title | Direct, specific, factual | Vague, salesy, clickbait |
| Link | GitHub repo or product page | Blog post or landing page |
| Description | Story of why + what it does | Marketing copy |
| Language | Technical, honest, factual | Buzzwords, hype, superlatives |
| Engagement | Reply to every comment | Ignore criticism |

## Title Formula

**"Show HN: [What it is] — [key differentiator or tech detail]"**

Examples:
- "Show HN: An open-source alternative to X built with Y"
- "Show HN: I built a tool that does X in Y seconds"
- "Show HN: CLI tool for Z, written in Rust"

## Timing

- Best days: Tuesday-Thursday (US business hours)
- Best time: 8-10 AM Eastern (when the HN audience is most active)
- Avoid weekends and holidays (lower traffic)

## Common Mistakes

- Sending friends the direct link to upvote (those votes get flagged/removed)
- Using marketing language (instant credibility loss on HN)
- Not responding to comments (the audience expects maker engagement)
- Getting defensive about criticism (HN feedback is harsh but valuable)
- Posting a landing page instead of the actual product or repo

## Success Metrics

A successful Show HN:
- Reaches the front page (top 30)
- Gets 50+ points
- Generates meaningful technical discussion
- Drives signups/stars for days after

A great Show HN:
- Stays on the front page for 6+ hours
- Gets 200+ points
- Gets referenced in follow-up posts and newsletters
