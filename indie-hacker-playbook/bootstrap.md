# Bootstrap — Indie Hacker Playbook

## 1. What This Is

The complete playbook for building and launching a product as a solo founder. From idea validation to first revenue. Practical patterns from founders who have actually done it — not startup theory. Search for what you need, get an actionable answer.

## 2. Where Are You?

| Phase | You are here if... | Start with |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Idea | You have an idea but have not validated it | `hub/validation.md` |
| Validation | You are testing demand before building | `research/validation/` |
| Building | You are building your MVP | `hub/building.md` |
| Launching | You are ready to put it in front of people | `hub/launching.md` |
| Growing | You have users and want revenue/growth | `hub/growth.md` |
| Operating | You need to sustain this long-term | `hub/operations.md` |

## 3. Where To Find Things

| Need | Search for | Or read directly |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Validate an idea | `validate idea mom test` | `hub/validation.md` |
| Build an MVP fast | `mvp build speed stack` | `hub/building.md` |
| Launch strategy | `launch product hunt show hn` | `hub/launching.md` |
| Set pricing | `pricing tiers free paid` | `hub/pricing.md` |
| Get customers | `first customers growth seo` | `hub/growth.md` |
| Stay productive | `time burnout solo founder` | `hub/operations.md` |
| Landing page copy | `landing page copy convert` | `templates/landing-page-copy.md` |
| Launch checklist | `launch checklist timeline` | `templates/launch-checklist.md` |
| Pricing page | `pricing page tiers design` | `templates/pricing-page.md` |
| Product Hunt | `product hunt launch day` | `entities/product-hunt.md` |
| Stripe setup | `stripe payments billing` | `entities/stripe.md` |

## 4. How To Use This Seed

```bash
# Search for anything
same search "how do I validate my idea"

# Or via MCP
mcp__same__search_notes(query="product hunt launch strategy", top_k=5)

# Find related notes
mcp__same__find_similar_notes(path="research/launching/product-hunt-playbook.md", top_k=3)
```

## 5. Key Principles

- **Ship fast, iterate later** — A launched MVP beats a perfect prototype every time
- **Charge from day one** — Free users do not validate willingness to pay
- **Distribution before product** — Build an audience first, then build what they need
- **Boring tech wins** — Reliability over novelty when you are the only engineer

## 6. Content Organization

- `hub/` — Category overviews, start here for any topic
- `research/` — Detailed guides, one question per file
- `entities/` — Living docs about platforms that change over time
- `templates/` — Fill-in-the-blank templates for copy, launches, pricing
- `decisions/` — Your project decisions, logged for future reference
