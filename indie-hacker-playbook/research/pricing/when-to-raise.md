# When to Raise Prices — Signs You Are Undercharging

## The Default State

Most indie hackers undercharge. This is almost universally true. If you have never raised your prices, you are probably undercharging. The fear of losing customers is almost always worse than the reality.

## Signs You Should Raise Prices

### Strong Signals
1. **Nobody complains about your price.** If zero people say "that is expensive," you are too cheap. Healthy pricing = 10-20% of prospects saying "too expensive."
2. **Your conversion rate is above 5%.** A high conversion rate means the price is not a barrier. Raise it until conversion drops to 2-4%.
3. **Customers say "this is a steal."** Take the compliment, then raise your price.
4. **You are overwhelmed with support for low-paying customers.** Low prices attract high-maintenance users.
5. **Competitors charge 3-5x more for similar value.** You are leaving money on the table.

### Medium Signals
6. **You added significant features since launch.** More value = higher price is justified.
7. **Your costs have increased.** AI API costs, hosting, third-party tools.
8. **You are burning out from too many users relative to revenue.** Higher prices, fewer but better customers.

## How to Raise Prices

### For New Customers
Just change the price. No announcement needed. New customers do not know the old price.

### For Existing Customers

**Option A: Grandfather existing users**
- Existing users keep their current price forever
- New users pay the new price
- Pro: Zero churn from price increase
- Con: Revenue increases slowly

**Option B: Give notice and increase**
- Email: "In 60 days, your plan will increase from $29 to $49. You can lock in $29/mo annual today."
- Pro: Revenue increases faster, some will upgrade to annual
- Con: Some churn (typically 5-15%)

**Option C: New tier structure**
- Add a new higher tier and move features up
- Existing users keep their current plan
- Some will naturally upgrade for the new features

## How Much to Raise

| Current price | Safe raise | Bold raise |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| $9/mo | $14/mo (+55%) | $19/mo (+111%) |
| $19/mo | $29/mo (+52%) | $39/mo (+105%) |
| $29/mo | $39/mo (+34%) | $49/mo (+69%) |
| $49/mo | $69/mo (+40%) | $99/mo (+102%) |

Bold raises work better than you think. If your product is genuinely valuable, most users will stay.

## The Math That Should Convince You

Scenario: You have 100 customers at $29/mo = $2,900 MRR

**If you raise to $49/mo:**
- Even if 30% leave (unlikely), you have 70 customers x $49 = $3,430 MRR
- You are making MORE money with FEWER customers and LESS support load

**If you raise to $79/mo:**
- Even if 50% leave (extreme), you have 50 customers x $79 = $3,950 MRR
- Still more revenue, dramatically less work

## When NOT to Raise Prices

- You are in the first month and still finding product-market fit
- Churn is already high (fix retention before changing price)
- You recently raised prices (wait 6-12 months between raises)
- Your product quality has decreased
- You are in a race-to-bottom market (compete on value, not price)

## The Psychological Barrier

The biggest barrier to raising prices is your own fear. You think: "Nobody will pay $49 for this." But you are not your customer. They might be a business saving $500/mo in labor. Your $49 is nothing to them.

Ask yourself: "If my product disappeared tomorrow, how much would it cost my users in time, money, or pain?" Price relative to that number, not relative to your comfort level.
