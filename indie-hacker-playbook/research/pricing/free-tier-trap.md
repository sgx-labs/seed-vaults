# The Free Tier Trap — When Free Helps vs. Kills Your Product

## The Trap

You launch with a generous free tier. Thousands of users sign up. You feel great. But nobody converts to paid. You are now supporting thousands of free users, paying for hosting, handling support tickets, and making $0. This is the free tier trap.

## When Free HELPS

| Scenario | Why free works |
|----------|---------------|
| Network effects | More users = more value (e.g., community platforms) |
| Marketplace | Need supply before demand pays (e.g., job boards) |
| Developer tools | Free open-source, paid cloud/enterprise |
| Viral products | Free users invite paid users (e.g., collaboration tools) |

## When Free KILLS

| Scenario | Why free hurts |
|----------|---------------|
| Solo founder with limited resources | Free users cost support time and hosting |
| B2B SaaS with clear ROI | Businesses that get value should pay for it |
| Low-volume, high-value tools | 100 paying users > 10,000 free users |
| Products without viral mechanics | Free users do not bring paid users |

## The Numbers

- Free-to-paid conversion: typically 1-5% for SaaS products
- That means for every 100 free users, 1-5 become paying
- If you need 100 paying customers for $1K MRR, you need 2,000-10,000 free users
- Each free user costs support time, hosting, and attention

## Alternatives to Free Tier

### Free Trial (best for most indie hackers)
- 7 or 14 days of full access, no credit card required
- User experiences the full value before deciding
- Creates urgency (trial expiration)
- Conversion rates: 5-15% (much higher than freemium)

### Money-Back Guarantee
- Charge full price, offer 14-30 day refund
- Attracts serious buyers, filters out tire-kickers
- Refund rates are typically low (5-10%)
- Psychologically, people who pay are more committed to using the product

### Limited Free + Generous Paid
- Free: 1 project, 100 requests/day, no export
- The free tier should be useful enough to show value but limited enough to create desire for paid
- Make the upgrade path obvious: "You have used 95 of 100 daily requests"

### Pay Once (Lifetime Deal)
- One-time payment for permanent access
- Works for tools, not for SaaS with ongoing costs
- Good for launching (immediate revenue) but creates no recurring revenue

## The Right Question

Instead of "Should I have a free tier?" ask:
1. **Do free users create value for paid users?** If yes, consider free tier.
2. **Can I afford to support free users?** If no (solo founder, limited time), skip it.
3. **Will free users eventually convert?** If the product does not have natural upgrade moments, they will not.

## Decision Framework

```
Are you a solo founder with limited time?
  YES → Free trial (14 days), no free tier
  NO → Continue

Does your product have network effects?
  YES → Free tier with clear upgrade path
  NO → Continue

Is your product B2B with clear ROI?
  YES → Free trial, charge from day one
  NO → Consider a limited free tier with upgrade hooks
```

## The Bottom Line

For most solo founders: start with a 14-day free trial, no free tier. You can always add a free tier later when you have revenue and capacity to support free users. You cannot easily take away a free tier once users expect it.
