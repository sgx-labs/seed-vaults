# Three-Tier Pricing — Good / Better / Best

## Why Three Tiers

Three tiers work because of anchoring and the compromise effect. When presented with three options, most people choose the middle one. The expensive tier makes the middle look reasonable. The cheap tier makes the middle look feature-rich.

## The Architecture

### Tier 1: Economy / Starter / Hobby
- **Purpose:** Entry point for price-sensitive users
- **Price:** $9-19/mo
- **What to include:** Core feature with usage limits
- **What to exclude:** Premium features, priority support, advanced analytics
- **Conversion goal:** Get them in the door, upgrade later

### Tier 2: Target / Pro / Growth (this is the one you want people to buy)
- **Purpose:** Your primary revenue tier
- **Price:** $29-69/mo
- **What to include:** Everything meaningful, generous limits
- **What to exclude:** Enterprise features (SSO, audit logs, SLA)
- **Visual cue:** "Most Popular" badge, highlighted border, larger CTA button
- **Conversion goal:** This is where 60-70% of revenue comes from

### Tier 3: Anchor / Business / Scale
- **Purpose:** Makes Tier 2 look like a bargain + captures high-value customers
- **Price:** 2-4x the middle tier ($99-199/mo)
- **What to include:** Everything + priority support + higher limits
- **What to exclude:** Nothing (or add white-glove features)
- **Conversion goal:** 10-20% of customers, but high LTV

## How to Differentiate Tiers

| Differentiator | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| Usage limits | 5 projects / 25 projects / Unlimited |
| Feature access | Basic analytics / Advanced analytics / Custom reports |
| Support level | Community / Email (24h) / Priority (4h) |
| Team size | 1 user / 5 users / Unlimited |
| Storage/bandwidth | 1GB / 10GB / 100GB |
| Integrations | 3 integrations / All integrations / Custom integrations |
| Branding | Your branding visible / White-label |

## Naming Your Tiers

| Pattern | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| Role-based | Freelancer | Team | Agency |
| Size-based | Starter | Growth | Scale |
| Quality-based | Basic | Pro | Enterprise |
| Usage-based | Hobby | Professional | Business |

Choose names that match your audience. "Hobby" works for dev tools. "Starter" works for business tools.

## The Annual Discount

Offer annual billing at a 20% discount (equivalent to 2 months free):
- Monthly: $29/mo = $348/year
- Annual: $24/mo = $288/year (save $60)

Annual billing improves cash flow, reduces churn, and shows commitment.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too many tiers** — 3 is the sweet spot. 4-5 creates decision paralysis.
2. **Tiers too close in price** — The gap should feel meaningful ($9/$29/$99, not $9/$12/$15)
3. **No clear "best value"** — Highlight the middle tier visually
4. **Enterprise tier without enterprise features** — If Tier 3 does not add real value, just have 2 tiers
5. **Hiding prices** — "Contact us for pricing" kills conversion for indie products

## Real-World Examples

- **Plausible Analytics:** Growth $9/mo, Business $19/mo, Enterprise custom
- **Crisp Chat:** Basic free, Pro $25/mo, Unlimited $95/mo
- **Buttondown:** Free, Basic $9/mo, Professional $29/mo

Notice the pattern: the middle tier is always the one they want you to buy.
