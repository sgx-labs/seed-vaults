# Pricing Psychology — The Science of What People Pay

## Anchoring

People evaluate price relative to a reference point. The first number they see becomes the anchor.

**How to use it:**
- Show the most expensive tier first (or at least prominently)
- Display "compared to" pricing: "Agencies charge $5,000/mo. We charge $49/mo."
- Show the value: "Saves 10 hours/week. That is worth $X at your hourly rate."

## The Decoy Effect

When choosing between 2 options, adding a 3rd "decoy" option makes one of the originals look better.

**Classic example:**
- Basic: $9/mo (limited)
- Pro: $29/mo (everything) <-- this is what you want them to buy
- Enterprise: $99/mo (everything + white glove support)

The Enterprise tier exists primarily to make Pro look like great value.

## Charm Pricing

$29 feels significantly cheaper than $30, even though the difference is $1. This works because people read left-to-right and the first digit dominates perception.

**Use $X9 pricing:** $9, $29, $49, $99, $199

**Exception:** Premium/luxury positioning uses round numbers ($50, $100) to signal quality.

## The Power of Free

"Free" is not just a price — it triggers an emotional reaction that makes people behave irrationally. People will choose a free option over a better-value paid option.

**Use free strategically:**
- Free trial (time-limited) > Free tier (permanent)
- Free trial shows confidence in your product
- Free tier attracts users who will never pay (see `research/pricing/free-tier-trap.md`)

## Loss Aversion

People feel losses twice as strongly as equivalent gains. Use this in your favor.

**How to use it:**
- "Your trial ends in 3 days" (fear of losing access)
- "Annual plan: Save $58/year" (framing the monthly plan as a loss)
- "Founding member price — goes up to $49/mo after launch" (urgency)

## Price-Quality Association

Higher prices signal higher quality. Charging too little can actually reduce perceived value.

**The indie hacker trap:** Pricing at $5/mo because you feel guilty charging more. This signals "this is not worth much" to potential customers.

**The fix:** Price based on value delivered, not on your imposter syndrome. If you save someone 5 hours/week and they earn $50/hour, your tool is worth $250/week to them. Charging $29/mo is a steal.

## Social Proof in Pricing

- "Most Popular" badge on the middle tier increases selection by 20-30%
- Showing the number of customers per tier creates herd behavior
- Testimonials near the pricing page reduce purchase anxiety

## The "Just Below" Threshold

There are psychological price thresholds: $10, $25, $50, $100. Staying just below these reduces friction.

| Threshold | Sweet spot | Feels like |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| $10 | $9/mo | Impulse buy |
| $25 | $19/mo | Low risk |
| $50 | $29-49/mo | Considered purchase |
| $100 | $79-99/mo | Serious business tool |

## The Indie Hacker Pricing Formula

1. Find what competitors charge for similar value
2. Price at 50-80% of the most popular competitor (you are newer, less proven)
3. Create 3 tiers (anchor, target, economy)
4. Use charm pricing ($X9)
5. Offer annual discount (2 months free)
6. Add a "Most Popular" badge to the tier you want people to buy
7. Test. If conversion is above 5%, raise prices. If below 1%, lower prices or improve messaging.
