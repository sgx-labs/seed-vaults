# Email List — Building and Using Your Owned Audience

## Why Email Matters

Social media followers are rented. Your email list is owned. Platforms change algorithms, suspend accounts, or die. Your email list goes with you. For indie hackers, email is the most reliable way to reach your audience.

## Building Your Email List

### Capture Points
1. **Waitlist before launch** — "Get early access" (highest intent)
2. **Blog sidebar/footer** — "Get weekly insights on [topic]"
3. **Content upgrades** — "Download the checklist" (in blog posts)
4. **Exit intent popup** — Shows when cursor moves to leave (use sparingly)
5. **After signup** — Existing product users are your best email audience

### What to Offer
People need a reason to give you their email. Offer:
- Early access to your product
- A free resource (template, guide, checklist)
- Weekly tips in your domain
- Product updates and changelog
- Exclusive discounts

## Email Sequences That Convert

### Welcome Sequence (5 emails over 10 days)
1. **Day 0:** Welcome + what to expect + quick win
2. **Day 2:** Your story — why you built this
3. **Day 4:** Most valuable tip or tutorial
4. **Day 7:** Social proof — testimonial or case study
5. **Day 10:** Soft CTA — "Ready to try [product]?"

### Trial-to-Paid Sequence (for free trial users)
1. **Day 0:** Welcome + getting started guide
2. **Day 3:** "Did you try [key feature]?"
3. **Day 7:** Tip for getting more value
4. **Day 10:** "Your trial ends in 4 days"
5. **Day 13:** "Last day — here is what you will lose"
6. **Day 14:** "Your trial ended — upgrade to keep access"

## Newsletter Strategy

### Frequency
- Weekly: High engagement if content is consistently good
- Biweekly: Good compromise for solo founders
- Monthly: Minimum viable frequency. Below this, people forget you.

### Format That Works
```
Subject: [Specific, curiosity-driven — not clickbait]

Hey [name],

[One insight or tip — something genuinely useful]

[Brief product update — what you shipped this week]

[One ask — feedback, share, or try a feature]

- [Your name]
```

### Subject Line Tips
- Keep it under 50 characters
- Be specific: "3 mistakes killing your SaaS pricing" beats "Newsletter #14"
- Use lowercase (feels personal, not corporate)
- A/B test if your tool supports it

## Metrics That Matter

| Metric | Good | Great |
|--------|------|-------|
| Open rate | 30-40% | 50%+ |
| Click rate | 2-5% | 5-10% |
| Unsubscribe rate | Under 0.5% | Under 0.2% |
| List growth rate | 5-10%/month | 15%+/month |

## Common Mistakes

- Buying email lists (spam, low engagement, damages sender reputation)
- Emailing too infrequently (people forget who you are)
- Only sending promotional emails (provide value every email)
- Not segmenting (new users vs. power users want different content)
- Making unsubscribe difficult (violates laws and erodes trust)
