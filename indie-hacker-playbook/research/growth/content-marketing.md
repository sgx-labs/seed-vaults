# Content Marketing — Blog Posts That Drive Signups

## The Content Marketing Loop

Write content --> Rank on Google --> Attract visitors --> Convert to users --> Users create content (testimonials, case studies) --> Write more content

This loop takes 3-6 months to start producing results, but once it does, it compounds. A single well-ranked blog post can drive 100+ signups per month for years.

## Content Types Ranked by Conversion

| Content type | Traffic potential | Conversion rate | Priority |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| "[Product] vs [Competitor]" | Medium | Very high | 1 |
| "Best [tool type] for [audience]" | High | High | 2 |
| "How to [solve problem]" | High | Medium | 3 |
| "[Specific use case] tutorial" | Low-Medium | High | 4 |
| Industry insights/trends | Medium | Low | 5 |

## The Content Playbook

### Comparison Posts (Write These First)
Create a page for every competitor comparing them to your product.

**Structure:**
1. Brief overview of both products
2. Feature comparison table
3. Pricing comparison
4. Who should use each one
5. Your recommendation (obviously, your product for most use cases)

These pages target high-intent keywords. Someone searching "ProductA vs ProductB" is actively choosing a tool.

### "Best X for Y" Lists
Write comprehensive lists of tools in your category.

**Structure:**
1. Introduction with criteria
2. 5-10 tools with pros/cons for each
3. Your product included naturally (not always #1 — that looks biased)
4. Summary recommendation

### How-To Tutorials
Write tutorials that solve problems your audience has.

**The key:** Your product should be part of the solution, not the entire post. Teach something genuinely useful, then mention your product as the tool that makes it easier.

## Writing for SEO + Conversion

1. **Target one keyword per post.** Use it in the title, H1, first paragraph, and URL.
2. **Match search intent.** If someone searches "how to," write a how-to guide, not a product pitch.
3. **Add a CTA.** Every post should have a relevant call-to-action. Not a banner — a contextual mention.
4. **Update regularly.** Add "[Year]" to titles and update content annually. "Best tools for X in 2026" beats undated content.
5. **Internal link.** Link between your blog posts and product pages. This distributes SEO authority.

## Content Production for Solo Founders

You do not need to publish daily. Quality over quantity.

| Cadence | Effort | Results |
|---------|--------|---------|
| 1 post/week | High | Fast compound growth |
| 2 posts/month | Medium | Steady growth after 6 months |
| 1 post/month | Low | Slow but still compounds |

**The minimum viable content strategy:**
- 3 comparison posts (one per competitor)
- 1 "best tools" listicle
- 2 how-to tutorials related to your product
- 1 launch story / about page

These 7 pieces of content, written well, can drive meaningful traffic within 3-6 months.

## Repurposing Content

One blog post becomes:
- A Twitter/X thread
- An Indie Hackers post
- A Reddit comment (answer a question with a link to your post)
- A newsletter email
- A YouTube script
- A podcast talking point

Write once, distribute everywhere.

## Tools for Content

- **Writing:** Google Docs or Notion (simple)
- **SEO research:** Ubersuggest (free), Ahrefs (paid)
- **Publishing:** Blog on your product domain (not Medium — you want the SEO value)
- **Analytics:** Google Search Console (free, essential for tracking rankings)
