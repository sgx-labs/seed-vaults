# SEO for Indie Hackers — Organic Traffic That Compounds

## Why SEO Matters for Solo Founders

SEO is the one marketing channel that compounds over time while requiring less effort as it matures. A blog post you write today can drive signups for years. For a solo founder, this is the closest thing to passive marketing.

## The Indie Hacker SEO Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. **Technical SEO:** Make sure your site is crawlable. Use Next.js, Astro, or any SSR framework. No SPA-only sites.
2. **Page speed:** Score 90+ on Lighthouse. Vercel and Netlify handle this well.
3. **Meta tags:** Title, description, and Open Graph tags on every page.
4. **Sitemap:** Generate automatically. Most frameworks have plugins for this.

### Phase 2: Programmatic Pages (Weeks 2-4)
Create pages at scale around your product's domain.

**Examples:**
- Tool comparison pages: "[Your Product] vs [Competitor]"
- Use case pages: "[Product] for [specific audience]"
- Directory/resource pages: "Best [category] tools in 2026"
- Template/example pages: "[X] templates for [audience]"

These pages target specific long-tail keywords with commercial intent.

### Phase 3: Content (Ongoing)
Write blog posts targeting questions your audience Googles.

**Finding keywords:**
- Use Google autocomplete (type your topic, see suggestions)
- Check Reddit and Quora for common questions
- Use free tools: Ubersuggest, Google Keyword Planner
- Target keywords with 100-1,000 monthly searches (less competition)
- Focus on long-tail: "how to set up Stripe subscriptions in Next.js" not "Stripe"

## Content That Ranks AND Converts

| Content type | SEO value | Conversion potential |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| "How to" tutorials | High | Medium (link to your tool as the solution) |
| "Best X for Y" lists | High | High (include your product) |
| "X vs Y" comparisons | High | High (position your product favorably) |
| Case studies | Medium | High (show real results) |
| Thought leadership | Low | Low (brand building, not conversion) |

## The 2025-2026 SEO Landscape

### What Changed
- Google's January 2026 update emphasizes personal brand and first-hand experience
- Generic AI-generated content gets filtered — authenticity wins
- E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) matters more than ever
- Building in public and sharing genuine insights is a competitive advantage

### What Still Works
- Long-tail keywords with clear search intent
- Comprehensive answers that genuinely help (not thin content)
- Technical tutorials with real code examples
- Pages that match search intent perfectly
- Internal linking between related pages

## Quick SEO Wins for Indie Hackers

1. **Add a blog to your product site** (same domain for authority)
2. **Write 5 posts targeting long-tail keywords** your audience searches
3. **Create comparison pages** for every competitor
4. **Add schema markup** for rich snippets (FAQ, How-To)
5. **Get backlinks from Product Hunt and HN** (launch creates natural links)
6. **Submit to directories** (MCP directories, SaaS directories, niche lists)

## Common SEO Mistakes

- Targeting high-volume competitive keywords (you will never rank for "project management")
- Writing thin 300-word posts (aim for 1,500-2,500 words for ranking potential)
- Ignoring search intent (informational vs. commercial vs. transactional)
- No internal linking between posts
- Expecting results in weeks (SEO takes 3-6 months to show results)
- Using a JavaScript SPA without server-side rendering
