# First 10 Customers — The Hardest and Most Important Milestone

## Why 10 Matters

Your first 10 paying customers validate your business more than any amount of signups, upvotes, or "looks cool" comments. They prove someone will exchange real money for what you built. Everything changes after 10.

## The 4-Step Playbook

### Step 1: Find Where Your Customers Hang Out
Before you can reach people, you need to know where they are.

| Audience type | Where to find them |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Developers | Hacker News, Reddit, GitHub, Dev.to, Discord |
| Designers | Dribbble, Twitter/X, Figma Community |
| Marketers | Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Marketing subreddits |
| Small business owners | Facebook Groups, local meetups, Reddit |
| Freelancers | Twitter/X, Upwork forums, niche communities |

### Step 2: Engage Before You Sell (1-2 Weeks)
Do NOT show up in a community and immediately promote your product. Instead:
- Answer questions in your domain
- Share useful insights
- Comment on other people's posts
- Build a reputation as someone who helps

### Step 3: Direct Outreach (The Unscalable Part)
Your first 10 customers come from manual, one-to-one outreach. This is intentionally unscalable.

**DM template (adapt to platform):**
```
Hey [name], I noticed you mentioned [specific problem] in [where].
I just built [product] that solves exactly that.
Would you be interested in trying it? Happy to give you
a discount as an early user in exchange for honest feedback.
```

**Key principles:**
- Reference something specific they said (not a mass message)
- Offer value, not a pitch
- Ask for feedback, not just a sale
- Offer a founding member discount (20-50% off)

### Step 4: Convert Trials to Paid
- Follow up on Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, and Day 12 of a 14-day trial
- Ask specific questions: "What is one thing that would make this a must-have for you?"
- Offer to hop on a quick call to help them set up
- At trial end: "Your trial is ending. Want to continue? Here is your founding member price."

## Timeline Expectations

- **Weeks 1-2:** Community engagement, building credibility
- **Weeks 3-4:** Start reaching out to potential users
- **Weeks 4-6:** First signups, first trials
- **Weeks 6-8:** First paying customers

Most founders report 6-8 weeks from starting outreach to their first paying customer. Some see results in 3-4 weeks with consistent daily effort.

## What Each Customer Teaches You

| Customer # | What you learn |
|-----------|---------------|
| 1-3 | Whether anyone will pay at all |
| 4-6 | What features matter most |
| 7-10 | Whether the pricing is right |
| 10+ | Whether the product retains |

## The Founding Member Strategy

Offer your first 10 customers a "founding member" deal:
- 30-50% lifetime discount
- Direct access to you (email, chat)
- Input on the roadmap
- Their name on a "founding members" page (optional)

In exchange, they give you:
- A testimonial
- Detailed feedback
- Patience with bugs
- Word-of-mouth referrals

## Common Mistakes

- Waiting for customers to find you (they will not)
- Mass-messaging people who have not expressed interest
- Giving up after 10 DMs with no response (you need 50-100 outreach attempts for 10 customers)
- Not following up (most conversions happen on the 2nd or 3rd touch)
- Discounting to $0 (free is not a customer, it is a user)
