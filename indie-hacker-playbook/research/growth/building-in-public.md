# Building in Public — What to Share, What to Keep Private

## What Building in Public Means

Openly sharing the journey of building your product — progress, setbacks, learnings, revenue, and decisions — in real-time. The goal is to build an audience that is invested in your success before your product is even ready.

## Why It Works

1. **Accountability:** Public commitment keeps you shipping
2. **Free marketing:** Every update is content that reaches potential customers
3. **Feedback loop:** Your audience tells you what to build
4. **Trust building:** Transparency creates trust faster than any marketing campaign
5. **Community:** You attract fellow builders who support and promote each other

## What to Share

### High Value (share freely)
- Revenue numbers (MRR, growth rate)
- User counts and milestones
- Technical decisions and tradeoffs
- Failures and what you learned
- The problem you are solving and why
- Weekly/monthly metrics updates
- Feature requests and how you prioritize

### Medium Value (share selectively)
- Your tech stack and architecture
- Marketing strategies that are working
- Pricing experiments and results
- Customer feedback (anonymized)
- Your daily workflow and tools

### Keep Private
- Customer data or identifiable information
- Proprietary algorithms or unique IP
- Security vulnerabilities (fix first, share lesson later)
- Exact details of growth hacks that competitors could copy instantly
- Personal financial details beyond product revenue
- Unresolved legal or compliance issues

## Where to Build in Public

| Platform | Audience | Content format |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| X/Twitter | Indie hackers, developers | Short updates, threads, screenshots |
| Indie Hackers | Bootstrapped founders | Long-form posts, milestones |
| Personal blog | Search traffic, newsletter | Detailed retrospectives |
| YouTube | Broader audience | Video logs, tutorials |
| Newsletter | Owned audience | Monthly updates, deep dives |

## Content Calendar for Building in Public

| Day | Content type |
|-----|-------------|
| Monday | Week plan: "This week I am working on..." |
| Wednesday | Progress update: screenshot, metric, or learning |
| Friday | Week review: "What I shipped, what I learned" |
| Monthly | Detailed metrics post: MRR, users, top learnings |
| Milestones | Celebration posts: first customer, $1K MRR, etc. |

## Real Examples

- **Pieter Levels** shares revenue dashboards publicly, including exact MRR for each product. This transparency has made him the face of indie hacking, driving more attention (and users) to his products.
- **Danny Postma** shared the entire journey of building HeadshotPro, from idea to $1M ARR. The build-in-public audience became early customers.
- **Marc Lou** documents every product launch in his 17-product portfolio, sharing revenue from day one.

## The Build-in-Public Formula

```
What I did + What happened + What I learned = Valuable content
```

Example: "I raised prices from $19 to $29. 3 customers churned but MRR went up 40%. Lesson: most users care about value, not price."

## Common Mistakes

- Only sharing wins (people follow for the real journey, including failures)
- Over-sharing every tiny detail (noise kills engagement)
- Not engaging with your audience (building in public is a conversation, not a broadcast)
- Starting to build in public only at launch (start from day one)
- Comparing yourself to founders who are years ahead of you
