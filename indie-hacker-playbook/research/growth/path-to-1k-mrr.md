# Path to $1K MRR — The First Revenue Milestone

## Why $1K MRR Matters

$1K MRR proves your product is a real business, not a side project. It means strangers are paying you monthly for something you built. It covers basic infrastructure costs. And it is the psychological proof that $5K, $10K, and beyond are possible.

## The Math

| Your price | Customers needed for $1K MRR |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| $9/mo | 112 customers |
| $19/mo | 53 customers |
| $29/mo | 35 customers |
| $49/mo | 21 customers |
| $99/mo | 11 customers |
| $199/mo | 6 customers |

Notice how pricing dramatically changes the game. At $9/mo, you need 112 customers. At $99/mo, you need 11. This is why charging more is almost always the right move for indie hackers.

## The Timeline

Realistic timelines from founders who have done it:

| Speed | Timeline | How |
|-------|---------|-----|
| Fast | 2-4 months | Strong audience, validated idea, high price |
| Average | 6-9 months | Building audience alongside product |
| Slow | 12-18 months | No audience, learning marketing while building |

## The $1K MRR Playbook

### Month 1: Foundation
- [ ] Ship your MVP
- [ ] Set up payments (start charging from day one)
- [ ] Launch on one channel (Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, or Show HN)
- [ ] Get your first 1-3 paying customers through direct outreach
- **Target: $50-100 MRR**

### Month 2: Iteration
- [ ] Fix the top 3 issues your first users reported
- [ ] Ship 1-2 features they asked for
- [ ] Launch on a second channel
- [ ] Start building in public on X/Twitter
- [ ] Write 2 blog posts for SEO
- **Target: $200-400 MRR**

### Month 3: Distribution
- [ ] Write comparison posts against competitors
- [ ] Post weekly on Indie Hackers with transparent updates
- [ ] Engage daily in communities where your users hang out
- [ ] Ask happy customers for testimonials
- [ ] Set up a referral incentive (even informal: "tell a friend, get a month free")
- **Target: $500-700 MRR**

### Month 4-6: Compound
- [ ] Double down on the channel that drove the most signups
- [ ] Raise prices (if conversion rate is above 5%)
- [ ] Add annual billing for cash flow
- [ ] Write a detailed milestone post ("From $0 to $500 MRR — here is how")
- [ ] Start an email list / newsletter
- **Target: $1,000 MRR**

## What Separates Founders Who Hit $1K MRR

1. **They charge enough.** $29+/mo means fewer customers needed.
2. **They ship fast.** MVP in 2-4 weeks, not 6 months.
3. **They do manual outreach.** First customers come from DMs, not SEO.
4. **They build in public.** Every update is free marketing.
5. **They persist.** Most give up at month 3. Success shows up at month 6.

## Real Examples

- **Habit Pixel:** $0 to $1K MRR in 8 months. Solo dev, iOS app, built and iterated based on user feedback.
- **WP Umbrella:** Bootstrapped to $110K MRR by the end of 2025. Started with manual outreach in WordPress communities.
- **Multiple portfolio founders:** Building 10-30 small apps, each generating $50-200/mo, diversifying revenue instead of going all-in on one product.

## After $1K MRR

$1K MRR is not the end — it is the start. At this point:
- You know your customers and what they want
- You have a distribution channel that works
- You can invest revenue back into growth (better hosting, a contractor, ads)
- You can start thinking about $5K MRR (see `hub/growth.md`)

The path from $1K to $5K is usually faster than $0 to $1K because you have momentum, testimonials, and SEO starting to compound.
