# The Mom Test — Talking to Users Without Leading Them

## The Core Idea

The Mom Test (from Rob Fitzpatrick's book) is a set of rules for asking questions that even your mom could not lie to you about. The principle: talk about their life, not your idea. If you pitch your idea, people will be polite and tell you it sounds great. That teaches you nothing.

## The Three Rules

1. **Talk about their life instead of your idea**
2. **Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future**
3. **Talk less and listen more**

## Questions That Work

| Bad question | Why it fails | Better question |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| "Do you think this is a good idea?" | Invites polite lies | "How do you currently handle [problem]?" |
| "Would you use this?" | Hypothetical, worthless | "When was the last time [problem] happened?" |
| "Would you pay $30/mo for this?" | Everyone says yes | "What are you paying for now to solve this?" |
| "What features would you want?" | You become a feature factory | "What is the hardest part about [process]?" |
| "Do you have this problem?" | Leading question | "Walk me through your last [workflow]." |

## What to Listen For

**Strong signals (build it):**
- They are already paying for a bad solution
- They describe the problem with emotion or frustration
- They have tried to build their own workaround
- They ask when your product will be ready

**Weak signals (be cautious):**
- "That sounds cool" (politeness, not validation)
- "I would definitely use that" (hypothetical, not commitment)
- "You should add X feature" (they are designing, not buying)

## How to Run Mom Test Conversations

1. **Find 5-10 potential users** — subreddits, Twitter, Slack groups, in-person
2. **Ask for 15 minutes** — frame it as learning, not selling
3. **Start broad** — "Tell me about the last time you dealt with [area]"
4. **Follow the energy** — when they get animated about a problem, dig deeper
5. **Ask for specifics** — "How much time did that take?" "What did you try?"
6. **End with commitment** — "Can I follow up when I have something to show you?"

## How Many Conversations?

5-10 conversations will give you a clear signal. If you hear the same problem described the same way 3+ times, that is a real pattern. If every conversation surfaces a different problem, your target audience is too broad.

## Common Mistakes

- Talking more than listening (you should talk 20%, listen 80%)
- Pitching your solution during the conversation
- Only talking to friends and family
- Taking compliments as validation
- Not asking about money (what they pay now, what they would pay)
