# Competitor Analysis — Learn From Existing Solutions

## Why Competitors Are Good News

If competitors exist, they have validated the market for you. People are already paying for solutions to this problem. Your job is not to have no competitors — it is to be better for a specific audience.

If there are zero competitors, ask why. Either you found a hidden gem (rare) or there is no demand (common).

## The 30-Minute Competitor Audit

For each competitor (analyze 3-5), capture:

1. **What they charge** — pricing page, tiers, free vs. paid
2. **What users complain about** — check reviews, Reddit, Twitter, G2, Capterra
3. **What their landing page emphasizes** — this is what they think matters
4. **How they acquire users** — SEO? Ads? Community? Product Hunt?
5. **How long they have existed** — maturity = entrenchment, but also baggage

## Where to Find Competitor Intelligence

| Source | What you learn |
|--------|---------------|
| G2 / Capterra reviews | User complaints = your opportunity |
| Reddit threads | Raw, unfiltered opinions |
| Twitter search | Real-time sentiment |
| SimilarWeb (free) | Traffic estimates, top channels |
| BuiltWith | Their tech stack |
| Their changelog/blog | Feature velocity, what they prioritize |
| Their pricing page | How they position tiers |

## Finding Your Angle

You do not need to be better at everything. You need to be significantly better at ONE thing.

| Angle | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Simpler | "Like [Competitor] but without the bloat" |
| Cheaper | "Enterprise features at indie hacker prices" |
| Faster | "Set up in 5 minutes, not 5 days" |
| Niche | "[Competitor] for [specific industry]" |
| Privacy | "Like [Competitor] but your data stays local" |
| Design | "A beautiful version of [Competitor]" |
| Integration | "[Competitor] but works with [popular tool]" |

## Red Flags to Watch For

- **Dominant monopoly** with deep pockets and network effects (e.g., building a social network)
- **Race to zero** — the space is already commoditized with free alternatives everywhere
- **Regulatory moat** — competitors have licenses/certifications you cannot easily get
- **Users do not care** — the problem is real but not painful enough to switch tools

## Green Lights

- Competitors have bad reviews but steady users (people want a solution, just not this one)
- Competitors charge a lot and users resent it (price disruption opportunity)
- The space is growing fast (rising tide lifts new boats too)
- Competitors are slow to ship (you can out-iterate them as a solo founder)
- Competitors target enterprise but ignore SMB/indie (niche down)
