# Idea Scoring — Framework for Evaluating Ideas

## The Indie Hacker Idea Scorecard

Rate each factor 1-5. A score of 20+ means the idea is worth pursuing. Below 15, keep looking.

| Factor | Question | Score (1-5) |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Pain** | How painful is this problem? (5 = "I would pay anything") | ___ |
| **Reach** | Can you find and reach these people? | ___ |
| **Revenue** | Will people pay $29+/mo for this? | ___ |
| **Feasibility** | Can YOU build this solo in 4-8 weeks? | ___ |
| **Moat** | Is there something that makes you hard to copy? | ___ |
| **Energy** | Are you excited to work on this for 2+ years? | ___ |
| **Total** | | ___/30 |

## Evaluating Each Factor

### Pain (most important)
- **5:** People actively searching for solutions, paying for bad ones
- **3:** Nice-to-have, people manage without it
- **1:** Solution looking for a problem

### Reach
- **5:** You know exactly where these people hang out (subreddits, Twitter, Slack)
- **3:** You can find them but it takes effort
- **1:** No idea how to reach potential customers

### Revenue
- **5:** B2B tool, saves money or time, clear ROI
- **3:** B2C tool, people will pay but need convincing
- **1:** Hard to monetize, "should be free" vibe

### Feasibility
- **5:** You have built similar things, tech is straightforward
- **3:** Need to learn some new tech, but manageable
- **1:** Requires deep expertise you do not have, or complex infrastructure

### Moat
- **5:** Network effects, unique data, or deep domain expertise
- **3:** Speed advantage or niche focus
- **1:** Anyone could clone this in a weekend

### Energy
- **5:** You think about this problem in the shower
- **3:** Interesting but not obsessed
- **1:** Only pursuing it because it seems profitable

## Quick Filters (Reject Immediately If...)

- You cannot describe the target customer in one sentence
- You do not know where to find 100 potential customers
- The solution requires a team of 5+ to build
- You need VC funding to get started
- The only monetization path is advertising
- You have zero personal interest in the domain

## The Best Indie Hacker Ideas Have These Traits

1. **Scratch your own itch** — you are the customer
2. **B2B micro-SaaS** — businesses pay more reliably than consumers
3. **Workflow automation** — save people time on repetitive tasks
4. **Existing market** — competitors exist but leave gaps
5. **Simple core** — one feature done well, not a platform

## Do Not Optimize for Ideas

The common mistake is spending months evaluating ideas instead of testing them. Pick the best one from your list, validate it in 1-2 weeks using the Mom Test and landing page test, and either build or move on. Speed of iteration beats quality of ideation.
