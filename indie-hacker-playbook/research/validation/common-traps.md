# Validation Traps — Mistakes That Waste Months

## Trap 1: Survey Validation

**The mistake:** Sending a survey asking "Would you use/pay for X?" and treating positive responses as validation.

**Why it fails:** Surveys measure opinions, not behavior. People are optimistic about hypothetical products. A 90% "yes" response rate on a survey often translates to 2% actual conversion.

**Instead:** Use the Mom Test. Talk to people about their current behavior and pain points, not your idea.

## Trap 2: Building as Validation

**The mistake:** "I will just build a quick version and see if people use it." Then spending 3 months building.

**Why it fails:** Building is not validating. You are testing your technical skills, not market demand. By the time you ship, you are emotionally invested and will rationalize lack of traction.

**Instead:** Landing page test or presale. Prove demand before writing code.

## Trap 3: Friends and Family Feedback

**The mistake:** Asking friends if your idea is good. They say yes. You proceed.

**Why it fails:** Friends want to support you. They will never say "this is a terrible idea." Even if they would use it, they are not your target market.

**Instead:** Talk to strangers who match your target customer profile.

## Trap 4: Competitor Blindness

**The mistake:** "Nobody is doing this! It must be a great opportunity!"

**Why it fails:** No competitors usually means no market. Someone has thought of this before — the fact that nobody built it might mean nobody wants it.

**Instead:** Find competitors. Their existence validates demand. Then find their weaknesses.

## Trap 5: Feature-First Thinking

**The mistake:** Starting with "I want to build X" instead of "People need a solution to Y."

**Why it fails:** You fall in love with the solution before understanding the problem. You build features nobody asked for.

**Instead:** Start with the problem. Interview people about their pain. Let the solution emerge from their needs.

## Trap 6: Over-Validation

**The mistake:** Running 50 user interviews, 3 landing page tests, and a 6-month beta before deciding to build.

**Why it fails:** Validation has diminishing returns. After 10-15 data points, you have enough signal. More validation is procrastination disguised as rigor.

**Instead:** Set a deadline. "I will validate for 2 weeks, then decide: build or kill."

## Trap 7: Vanity Metrics

**The mistake:** Celebrating Twitter likes, email signups, or "this looks cool" comments as validation.

**Why it fails:** Attention is not demand. People like things on social media that they would never pay for. Email signups convert at 1-5%.

**Instead:** Track commitment metrics: presales, credit card signups, or specific time commitments ("I will beta test this for 30 minutes next Tuesday").

## The Validation Checklist

Before moving to build, confirm:
- [ ] 5+ conversations with target users who described the problem unprompted
- [ ] At least 1 signal of willingness to pay (presale, stated price, current spending)
- [ ] You can describe the customer and problem in one sentence each
- [ ] You know where to find 100+ potential customers
- [ ] Competitors exist (validates the market)
