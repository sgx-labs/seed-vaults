# Preselling — Get Paid Before You Build

## Why Preselling Is the Strongest Validation

Email signups show interest. Presales show willingness to pay. Someone putting $29 on a credit card for a product that does not exist yet is the strongest possible signal that you should build it. If nobody will presell, reconsider the idea or the price.

## How to Structure a Presale

### Option 1: Lifetime Deal (LTD)
- "Pay $49 once, get lifetime access when it launches"
- Works well for tools and SaaS
- Sets a clear value anchor for future pricing
- Platforms: Gumroad, Lemon Squeezy, or Stripe Payment Links

### Option 2: Discounted Annual
- "Pay $99/year (50% off launch price) for founding member access"
- Works for subscription products
- Creates recurring revenue from day one

### Option 3: Pre-order with Refund Guarantee
- "Pre-order for $29. Full refund if it doesn't ship in 90 days."
- Removes buyer risk
- Creates a deadline for yourself

## The Presale Page

Everything from the landing page test, PLUS:
- **Price and buy button** — make it real, use Stripe or Gumroad
- **What they get** — be specific about deliverables
- **Timeline** — when will it ship (be honest, add buffer)
- **Guarantee** — refund policy removes risk
- **Scarcity** — "First 50 founding members" or "Price goes up after launch"

## Setting the Right Price

- **Too low ($5-9):** Does not validate real willingness to pay
- **Sweet spot ($29-99):** Enough to mean something, low enough to be impulse
- **Higher ($199+):** Fewer buyers but stronger signal per buyer

Rule of thumb: Price the presale at 50% of what you plan to charge at launch.

## How Many Presales Do You Need?

| Number | Signal |
|--------|--------|
| 0 | Stop. Rethink the idea, audience, or messaging. |
| 1-5 | Weak but not zero. Might need better distribution. |
| 5-20 | Solid signal. Build it. |
| 20-50 | Strong. You have a business. |
| 50+ | Exceptional. Ship as fast as possible. |

## Managing Presale Customers

1. **Send immediate confirmation** with expected timeline
2. **Update monthly** — share progress, screenshots, decisions
3. **Invite to beta first** — they paid, they get priority
4. **Deliver on time** — or communicate delays early
5. **Over-deliver** — add a bonus they did not expect

## Common Mistakes

- Preselling without a plan to build (this is fraud, not validation)
- Setting the price too low to validate real demand
- Not having a refund policy (destroys trust)
- Over-promising features in the presale description
- Taking the money and going silent (update your presale customers regularly)
