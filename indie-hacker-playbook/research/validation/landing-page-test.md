# Landing Page Test — Validate Before Building

## The Concept

Build a landing page that describes your product as if it exists. Add an email capture or waitlist. Drive traffic to it. If people sign up, you have demand signal. If nobody signs up, you saved yourself months of building.

## The Setup (Under $50, Under a Weekend)

1. **Domain:** $12/year from Namecheap or Cloudflare
2. **Page builder:** Carrd ($19/year), Framer (free tier), or hand-coded with Tailwind
3. **Email capture:** Buttondown (free), ConvertKit (free tier), or Mailchimp
4. **Traffic source:** Reddit post, Twitter thread, or $20-50 in ads

## What the Page Needs

- **Headline:** Clearly state what it does and for whom
- **Subheadline:** How it works in one sentence
- **3-4 bullet points:** Key benefits (not features)
- **Email capture:** "Join the waitlist" or "Get early access"
- **Optional:** Mockup screenshot (can be a Figma design, does not need to work)

## What the Page Does NOT Need

- Working product behind it
- Perfect design
- Multiple pages
- Blog or documentation
- Pricing (too early)

## Measuring Success

| Metric | How to interpret |
|--------|-----------------|
| 0-1% signup rate | Weak — message or audience mismatch |
| 2-5% signup rate | Promising — worth building an MVP |
| 5-10% signup rate | Strong — build it now |
| 10%+ signup rate | Exceptional — you hit a nerve |

Signup rate = (email signups / unique visitors) x 100

## Traffic Sources for Testing

| Source | Cost | Volume | Quality |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| Reddit post (relevant subreddit) | Free | Medium | High |
| Twitter/X thread | Free | Variable | Medium |
| Indie Hackers post | Free | Low-Medium | High |
| Google Ads | $20-50 | Medium | High |
| Facebook/Instagram Ads | $20-50 | High | Medium |

## What to Do With Signups

1. **Thank them immediately** — automated welcome email
2. **Ask one question** — "What is the #1 thing you would want this to do?"
3. **Keep them warm** — send brief updates every 2 weeks
4. **Invite to beta** — when your MVP is ready, these are your first users
5. **Ask for presale** — "Would you pay $X for early access?" (strongest signal)

## Real Examples

- Buffer validated by creating a landing page describing the product before writing any code. Signups proved demand before development.
- Many successful indie hackers on Indie Hackers and X report using this method, with some generating 200+ waitlist signups in the first week from a single Reddit post.

## Common Mistakes

- Making the page too complicated (one page, one CTA)
- Not driving traffic (a page nobody sees proves nothing)
- Treating signups as guaranteed customers (most will not convert)
- Waiting too long to build after validation (momentum fades)
