# Solo Support — Handling Customer Support Alone

## The Support Paradox

Great support is your competitive advantage as a solo founder. Big companies have slow, impersonal support. You can respond personally in minutes. But support can also consume your entire day if you do not manage it.

## Setting Up Support Without Overhead

### Tier 1: Self-Serve (handles 60-80% of questions)
1. **FAQ page** — Answer the top 10 questions you get asked
2. **Getting started guide** — Reduce "how do I start?" tickets to zero
3. **Changelog** — "What is new?" questions answered proactively
4. **Status page** — "Is it down?" questions eliminated

### Tier 2: Async Support (handles most of the rest)
- **Email** — Simple, no extra tools needed (support@yourdomain.com)
- **Help widget** — Crisp (free tier), Intercom, or Helpscout
- Set expectations: "We respond within 24 hours"

### Tier 3: Direct Access (for high-value customers)
- Slack/Discord channel for premium customers
- Short Loom video responses for complex issues
- Quick video call for onboarding (15 min max)

## Support Workflow

### When Support Arrives
1. Is this answered in the FAQ? Send the link. Then add it to FAQ if it is not there.
2. Is this a bug? Reproduce, fix, deploy, respond with fix confirmation.
3. Is this a feature request? Add to a list, thank them, do not promise a timeline.
4. Is this a billing issue? Resolve immediately (billing = trust).

### Batching Support
Do not check support continuously throughout the day. Instead:
- **Check twice daily:** Morning and late afternoon
- **Respond within 24 hours** (set this expectation publicly)
- **Urgent issues** (site down, payment broken): set up alerts that bypass your batch schedule

## Response Templates

Save templates for common responses. Not robotic copy-paste, but starting points you personalize.

**Bug report response:**
```
Thanks for reporting this — I was able to reproduce the issue and
just deployed a fix. Can you try again and let me know if it is
resolved? Appreciate you taking the time to report it.
```

**Feature request response:**
```
Great suggestion — I have added this to the feature request list.
I cannot promise a specific timeline, but knowing this matters to
you helps me prioritize. Thank you for the feedback.
```

**"How do I..." response:**
```
Good question — here is a quick guide: [link to help doc].
If that does not cover your case, let me know and I will help
you work through it.
```

## Turning Support Into Product

Every support ticket is a product insight:

| Support pattern | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| Same question 3+ times | Add to FAQ / improve onboarding |
| Multiple bug reports for same feature | Fix it, add test coverage |
| Feature request from 3+ users | Move it up the roadmap |
| Confusion about a feature | Improve the UI or add a tooltip |
| Billing confusion | Simplify pricing or add FAQ |

## Support Tools for Solo Founders

| Tool | Cost | Best for |
|------|------|----------|
| Plain email | Free | Simplest option, under 50 users |
| Crisp | Free (basic) | Chat widget + basic ticketing |
| Helpscout | $20/mo | Email-based support with docs |
| Intercom | $74/mo | Chat + email + knowledge base |

For most indie hackers at early stage: email + an FAQ page. Add a chat widget when you hit 50+ active users.

## When to Hire Help

Consider outsourcing support when:
- Support takes more than 1 hour per day consistently
- You are losing time for building because of support volume
- Your MRR can cover $500-1,000/month for a part-time contractor
- The questions are repetitive (easy to train someone on)
