# Pivot or Persevere — When to Change Direction

## The Hardest Decision

Every founder faces this: "Is it not working YET, or is it not working EVER?" There is no guaranteed answer, but there are signals that help you decide.

## Signals to Persevere

### Strong Signals (Keep Going)
- Users who pay are happy and staying (low churn)
- You are getting organic word-of-mouth referrals
- People contact you asking to buy (inbound interest)
- Usage metrics are trending up, even slowly
- Your best customers would be upset if you shut down

### Medium Signals (Keep Going but Adjust)
- Growth is slow but consistent
- Users like the product but want different features
- The market is growing (even if your share is small)
- You have not yet tried all distribution channels

## Signals to Pivot

### Strong Signals (Change Something)
- 3+ months of zero revenue growth despite marketing effort
- High churn (above 10%/month) with no clear fix
- Users sign up but never come back (engagement death)
- You cannot find people who care about the problem
- Every conversation reveals a different problem (no pattern)

### Medium Signals (Consider a Change)
- Your happiest users use the product for something different than intended
- A small feature gets more attention than the core product
- You dread working on it (and it is not just burnout)
- Competitors have consolidated and you cannot differentiate

## Types of Pivots

Not every pivot means starting over. Most pivots keep something and change something else.

| Pivot type | What changes | What stays | Example |
|-----------|-------------|------------|---------|
| Audience pivot | Who you sell to | The product | B2C to B2B |
| Problem pivot | Problem you solve | The audience | Time tracking to invoicing |
| Channel pivot | How you reach users | Product + audience | Self-serve to sales-led |
| Feature pivot | Core feature | Domain | Analytics to reporting |
| Pricing pivot | How you charge | Product | Subscription to one-time |
| Platform pivot | Where it runs | Core functionality | Web to mobile or CLI |

## The Pivot Decision Framework

### Ask These Questions
1. **Do users who stay love it?** If yes, you have a retention problem, not a product problem. Find more users like them.
2. **Is anyone paying?** If no one will pay after 3+ months of trying, the value proposition is wrong.
3. **What would users miss?** Ask: "If this product disappeared tomorrow, what would you miss?" The answer reveals your real value.
4. **What is working?** Even in a failing product, something is working. Double down on that.
5. **Would you start this again today?** Sunk cost fallacy is real. Would you choose this problem again with fresh eyes?

### The Kill Criteria
Set these BEFORE you launch:
- "If I do not have 10 paying customers in 3 months, I will pivot or kill."
- "If churn is above 15% for 2 consecutive months, I will investigate and potentially pivot."
- "If I cannot achieve $500 MRR in 6 months, I will reassess."

Having predetermined criteria removes emotion from the decision.

## How to Pivot Well

1. **Talk to your users first.** Understand what they value before changing everything.
2. **Pivot one thing at a time.** Do not change product, audience, AND pricing simultaneously.
3. **Keep your distribution.** If you have an audience, pivot the product to what they need.
4. **Move fast.** A pivot should take weeks, not months. It is not a restart — it is a redirect.
5. **Communicate transparently.** Tell existing users what is changing and why.

## The Real Lesson

Most successful indie products pivoted at least once. Pieter Levels built 12 projects in 12 months — most failed, a few became million-dollar businesses. The skill is not picking the right idea on the first try. The skill is recognizing when to change direction quickly.
