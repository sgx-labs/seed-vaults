# Common Mistakes — What Kills Indie Projects

## The Fatal Mistakes (Each One Kills Projects)

### 1. Building for 6 Months in Stealth Mode
**The mistake:** "I will launch when it is ready." It is never ready. You build for months, launch to crickets, and realize you built the wrong thing.

**The fix:** Ship your MVP in 2-4 weeks. Get it in front of real users. Iterate based on feedback. Your first version should embarrass you.

### 2. Not Charging Money
**The mistake:** "I will add pricing later once I have users." Free users do not validate a business. You end up with 1,000 free users, no revenue, and no idea if anyone would pay.

**The fix:** Charge from day one. Even $9/mo. One paying customer is worth more than 1,000 free signups.

### 3. Building Distribution After the Product
**The mistake:** Building in isolation, then trying to find users. You have a product but no audience, no community presence, and no distribution channel.

**The fix:** Start building in public and engaging in communities from day one. Build your audience WHILE building your product.

### 4. Optimizing Too Early
**The mistake:** A/B testing your signup flow when you have 20 visitors/day. Rewriting your codebase for "scalability" when you have 5 users. Building a custom analytics dashboard.

**The fix:** Do things that do not scale. Manual outreach. Personal emails. Direct support. Optimize when you have 100+ users and clear data.

### 5. Feature Creep
**The mistake:** "If I just add one more feature, people will start paying." They will not. You end up with a bloated product that does many things poorly instead of one thing well.

**The fix:** Ship the core feature. If nobody wants the core feature, adding features will not help. If they do want it, they will tell you what to build next.

### 6. Copying Successful Products Feature-for-Feature
**The mistake:** "I will build an X clone but better." You cannot out-feature an established product with a team and funding.

**The fix:** Find one specific audience or use case that the big product serves poorly. Be the best at that narrow thing.

### 7. Ignoring Distribution
**The mistake:** "My product is so good, people will find it." They will not. The internet is too crowded. Nobody is searching for your product name.

**The fix:** 50% of your time should be distribution (marketing, community, content, outreach). Most developers spend 95% on building and 5% on distribution.

### 8. Underpricing
**The mistake:** Pricing at $5/mo because "who would pay more?" Attracting the worst customers who are most price-sensitive and most demanding.

**The fix:** Price based on value, not your discomfort. If your tool saves someone 5 hours/week, $29/mo is cheap.

### 9. Solo Isolation
**The mistake:** Working alone without talking to anyone. No feedback loop, no accountability, no emotional support.

**The fix:** Join a community. Share your progress. Find 2-3 founder friends. Building alone does not mean being alone.

### 10. Perfectionism
**The mistake:** Spending 2 weeks on pixel-perfect design when nobody has seen the product yet. Rewriting code that works. Obsessing over edge cases.

**The fix:** "Good enough" ships. Perfect never does. You can always improve later — with the benefit of user feedback.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Most indie products fail. The median outcome is $0 in revenue. But the founders who succeed share common traits:
- They shipped fast
- They charged money
- They talked to users
- They iterated based on feedback
- They persisted through the hard months
- They took care of themselves along the way

Every mistake on this list is recoverable if you catch it early. That is the purpose of this playbook — to help you catch them early.
