# Burnout Prevention — Sustainable Pace for Solo Founders

## Why Burnout Kills More Projects Than Competition

The #1 reason indie projects fail is not bad ideas, bad marketing, or bad code. It is that the founder burned out and quit. Solo founding is uniquely isolating: no team to share the load, no boss to set boundaries, no co-founder to keep you accountable. You have to protect yourself.

## The Warning Signs

### Early Signs (Act Now)
- You dread working on the project
- You are irritable about user feedback
- You skip exercise, sleep, or social activities
- You are working every evening and weekend
- You check metrics obsessively

### Middle Signs (Serious)
- You procrastinate on important tasks
- You lose interest in the problem you are solving
- Quality of work decreases noticeably
- You compare yourself negatively to other founders
- You have physical symptoms: headaches, insomnia, fatigue

### Late Signs (Crisis)
- You want to shut the project down entirely
- You resent your users
- You have not shipped anything in weeks
- You feel trapped

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Set Non-Negotiable Boundaries
- **Maximum hours per week:** Set a cap (10-15 hours if you have a day job)
- **One full day off per week:** No code, no metrics, no support
- **Vacation:** Take at least one week off every quarter. Your product will survive.

### 2. Build Systems, Not Heroics
- Automate support with FAQ pages and help docs
- Set up monitoring so you are not manually checking uptime
- Use templates for common responses
- Batch similar tasks (support Monday, marketing Thursday)

### 3. Celebrate Small Wins
- First signup? Celebrate.
- First dollar? Celebrate.
- Feature shipped? Celebrate.
- Most founders only celebrate big milestones and feel like they are failing in between.

### 4. Connect with Other Builders
- Join a community: Indie Hackers, builder Discord, local meetup
- Find 2-3 founder friends to share progress with
- Attend virtual or in-person founder meetups monthly
- Solo does not mean alone. Isolation accelerates burnout.

### 5. Physical Health is Non-Negotiable
- Exercise 3+ times per week (even a 30-minute walk counts)
- Sleep 7-8 hours (no, you cannot function well on 5)
- Eat real food (meal prep on Sunday = healthy week)
- Limit caffeine after 2 PM

### 6. Manage Expectations
- $1K MRR typically takes 6-12 months, not 6 weeks
- Most "overnight successes" took years of invisible work
- Progress is not linear — there will be flat months
- You are competing against your yesterday self, not against other founders

## The Burnout Recovery Playbook

If you are already burned out:

1. **Take a break.** 1-2 weeks minimum. No code, no metrics.
2. **Tell your users.** "Taking a short break, back on [date]." They will understand.
3. **Reconnect with why.** Why did you start this? What excited you?
4. **Lower the bar.** Set a tiny goal for your first week back. Ship one small thing.
5. **Reduce scope.** Cut features. Simplify. Less product = less maintenance.
6. **Get support.** Talk to a friend, therapist, or fellow founder.

## The Sustainability Mindset

Think in years, not weeks:
- 2 focused hours/day x 5 days/week x 50 weeks = 500 hours/year
- 500 hours is enough to build, launch, and grow a real product
- But only if you do not burn through those hours in the first 3 months

The founders who win are not the ones who work the most hours. They are the ones who are still working on their project two years from now.
