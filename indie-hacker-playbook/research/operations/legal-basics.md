# Legal Basics — LLC, Terms, Privacy Policy

## Disclaimer

This is general information, not legal advice. Consult a lawyer for your specific situation. That said, here is what most indie hackers need to know to avoid obvious mistakes.

## Business Entity (Do You Need an LLC?)

### When to Form an LLC
- You have paying customers (yes, even 1)
- You process payments and hold customer data
- You want to separate personal and business liability

### When You Can Wait
- Pre-launch, no customers, no revenue
- Just testing ideas with a landing page
- Under $1K total revenue

### LLC Setup (US)
1. Choose a state (Delaware or Wyoming for simplicity, your home state for cost)
2. File Articles of Organization ($50-300 depending on state)
3. Get an EIN from the IRS (free, takes 5 minutes online)
4. Open a business bank account (separate from personal)
5. Total cost: $50-500 + $50-300/year maintenance

### Alternatives
- **Sole proprietorship:** Default if you do nothing. No legal protection. Not recommended once you have customers.
- **S-Corp:** Tax benefits above ~$40K/year profit. More complexity. Talk to an accountant.
- **International founders:** Research your country's equivalent (Ltd in UK, GmbH in Germany, etc.)

## Terms of Service

Every product needs Terms of Service. They protect you by defining:
- What your product does (and does not guarantee)
- How users can and cannot use it
- Your liability limitations
- How disputes are handled
- Your right to change the service

### How to Get Terms of Service
| Method | Cost | Quality |
|--------|------|---------|
| Termly / Iubenda | $10-30/mo | Good enough for most indie products |
| Lawyer-drafted template | $200-500 one-time | Good |
| Custom lawyer review | $500-2,000 | Best |
| Copy from a competitor | $0 | Do not do this |

For early-stage: Termly or Iubenda generated terms are sufficient. Get a lawyer review when you have revenue.

## Privacy Policy

Required by law in most jurisdictions if you collect any user data (including email addresses, analytics, cookies).

Must include:
- What data you collect
- How you use it
- Who you share it with (analytics, payment processor, email tool)
- How users can request data deletion
- Cookie usage

### How to Get a Privacy Policy
Same options as Terms of Service. Termly and Iubenda generate GDPR and CCPA-compliant policies automatically based on your tech stack.

## GDPR (If You Have EU Users)

If any of your users are in the EU, you must comply with GDPR:
- Get consent before collecting data
- Allow data export and deletion
- Do not use dark patterns for consent
- List all third parties that process data
- Cookie consent banner (annoying but legally required)

## Billing and Tax

### Sales Tax / VAT
- **If using Lemon Squeezy or Paddle:** They handle this as Merchant of Record
- **If using Stripe directly:** You are responsible for tax compliance
- **Stripe Tax:** Automates calculation and collection (0.5% per transaction)

### Income Tax
- Revenue from your product is taxable income
- Keep records of all revenue and expenses
- Set aside 25-30% of profit for taxes (US)
- Hire an accountant when you hit $5K+ MRR (the ROI of a good accountant is real)
