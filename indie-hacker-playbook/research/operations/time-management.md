# Time Management — The 2-Hour Founder

## The Reality

If you have a day job, you have roughly 2 focused hours per day for your side project. Before work, after work, or during lunch. These 2 hours are precious. Every minute spent on the wrong thing is a minute not spent shipping.

## The 2-Hour Rule

You can accomplish a remarkable amount in 2 focused hours if you eliminate all decision-making and context-switching. The key: decide what to work on BEFORE your 2-hour block starts.

## Weekly Schedule

| Day | Focus area | Example tasks |
|-----|-----------|---------------|
| Monday | Build | Code the highest-priority feature |
| Tuesday | Build | Continue coding, ship if ready |
| Wednesday | Build | Fix bugs, improve based on feedback |
| Thursday | Market | Write a blog post, engage on X, send outreach |
| Friday | Admin | Answer support emails, review metrics, plan next week |
| Saturday | Deep work (optional) | Larger features, strategic thinking |
| Sunday | Rest | Actually rest. Burnout kills more projects than competition. |

## Before Your 2-Hour Block

The night before or during your commute, decide exactly what you will work on:
1. Open your to-do list
2. Pick ONE task
3. Break it into a concrete first step
4. Close everything else

When your 2 hours start, you should be able to sit down and immediately begin. No deciding, no email, no Slack, no "let me just check Twitter."

## Protecting Your Time

### Energy Management
- Morning people: wake up 2 hours early, work before your day job
- Night people: work 2 hours after the kids are asleep
- Match your best energy to your hardest task

### Eliminating Distractions
- Phone in another room (not face down on desk — in another room)
- Website blockers: Cold Turkey, Freedom, or SelfControl
- Close Slack, email, and social media
- Use a timer (Pomodoro: 25 min work, 5 min break, repeat)

### Saying No
- No to meetings that could be emails
- No to features that users have not asked for
- No to redesigns when the current design works
- No to learning a new framework when you know one that works
- No to perfectionism in general

## What to Work On

### High-Leverage Activities (do these first)
1. Ship a feature a paying customer asked for
2. Fix a bug that is causing churn
3. Write content that will drive signups for months
4. Direct outreach to potential customers

### Low-Leverage Activities (minimize or batch)
1. Tweaking CSS
2. Refactoring code that works
3. Setting up analytics dashboards
4. Researching tools you do not need yet
5. Reading about other people's success

## The Weekly Review (15 Minutes on Friday)

1. What did I ship this week?
2. What did I learn from users?
3. What is the ONE most important thing for next week?
4. Am I making progress toward $1K MRR?
5. Am I enjoying this? (if no for 4 weeks straight, something needs to change)

## When to Quit Your Day Job

Do NOT quit your day job until:
- [ ] Your side project revenue covers 6-12 months of living expenses (saved, not projected)
- [ ] MRR has been growing consistently for 3+ months
- [ ] Churn is under control (under 5%)
- [ ] You have tried working on it part-time for at least 6 months
- [ ] You are emotionally ready for the income instability

Most successful indie hackers recommend keeping your day job longer than you think you should.
