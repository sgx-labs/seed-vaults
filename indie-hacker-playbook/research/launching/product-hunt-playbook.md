# Product Hunt Launch Playbook — From Prep to Post-Launch

## Timeline

### 4 Weeks Before
1. **Create your PH account** and start engaging (upvote, comment on other products)
2. **Follow other makers** in your space — build relationships
3. **Create a Coming Soon page** — share the link to build followers

### 2 Weeks Before
4. **Prepare all assets:**
   - Tagline (60 chars max, clear value proposition)
   - Description (280 chars, what it does and for whom)
   - Gallery (5-8 images or GIFs showing the product)
   - Maker's comment (WHY you built this — tell a story)
   - First comment (deeper context, background, ask for feedback)
5. **Record a demo video** (60-90 seconds, show the product working)
6. **Write FAQ** (3-5 common questions)

### 1 Week Before
7. **Choose your launch day:**
   - Tue-Thu: More competition but more traffic
   - Sat-Sun: Easier to rank #1, lower total traffic
   - Monday needs ~633 upvotes for #1, Saturday needs ~366
8. **Email your waitlist** — tell them the exact date and ask for support
9. **DM supporters** — personal messages to 20-30 people who might upvote

### Launch Day (Midnight PT)
10. **Post at 12:01 AM Pacific** — the day starts at midnight
11. **Drop your maker's comment immediately** — explain WHY you built it
12. **Share on social media** — but do NOT say "upvote me on Product Hunt"
13. **Post in communities** — Indie Hackers, Twitter, relevant Slack/Discord groups
14. **Respond to EVERY comment** within 30 minutes
15. **Share progress updates** throughout the day (screenshots of traction)

### Post-Launch
16. **Thank supporters publicly** with a follow-up post
17. **Email everyone who signed up** within 48 hours
18. **Write a "what I learned" post** — great content and builds credibility
19. **Plan your relaunch** — PH allows relaunching for major updates

## What the PH Team Evaluates (2025-2026)

- **Usefulness:** Does it solve a real problem?
- **Quality:** Is it polished and functional?
- **Novelty:** Is it different from what already exists?
- **Maker engagement:** Are you responding to comments?
- The PH team MANUALLY curates the homepage — filtering is strict

## Common Mistakes

- Asking friends to "go upvote" (voting rings get detected and penalized)
- Sending direct links to the post (those upvotes may not count)
- Treating it as a one-time event (relaunch with every major update)
- Generic tagline like "The best tool for X" (be specific about what it does)
- No maker's comment (misses the storytelling opportunity)
- Launching without any community engagement beforehand

## Realistic Expectations

| Outcome | What it means |
|---------|--------------|
| Top 5 of the day | 200-500+ website visits, 50-200 signups |
| Top 10 of the day | 100-300 website visits, 20-80 signups |
| Below top 10 | 30-100 website visits, 5-20 signups |
| Not on homepage | Minimal traffic (page was filtered by PH team) |

Product Hunt is a spike, not a sustained channel. The real value is the badge ("Product of the Day") and the backlink for SEO.
