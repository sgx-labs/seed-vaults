# Show HN Playbook — Getting on the Hacker News Front Page

## Before You Post

### Is Your Product Right for HN?

**Good fit:**
- Developer tools, CLI tools, open source projects
- Novel technical approaches (new algorithms, unique architecture)
- Privacy-focused alternatives to big tech
- Self-hostable software
- Useful utilities that solve real problems

**Bad fit:**
- Yet another AI wrapper with no technical depth
- B2C consumer apps (unless technically interesting)
- Marketing-focused products with no technical story
- Products that require a demo account to evaluate

### Prepare Your Post

**Title format:** `Show HN: [What it is] — [key differentiator]`

Good titles:
- "Show HN: An open-source alternative to Notion built with Rust"
- "Show HN: CLI tool that generates API clients from OpenAPI specs in seconds"
- "Show HN: I built a local-first note search engine with SQLite and vector embeddings"

Bad titles:
- "Show HN: The best project management tool ever" (salesy)
- "Show HN: Check out my new startup" (vague)
- "Show HN: AI-powered everything for everyone" (buzzword soup)

**Description (text body):**
1. One sentence: what it does
2. One sentence: why you built it (what problem you had)
3. One sentence: how it works (the technical approach)
4. Link to the live demo or GitHub repo
5. What feedback you are looking for

## Posting

**Timing:**
- Best: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM Eastern
- Avoid: Weekends and holidays (lower traffic)
- The Show HN tab is less competitive than the main page, giving you more time

**Link:** Point to the product/repo, NOT a blog post about it

**Do NOT:**
- Ask friends to upvote (HN detects this aggressively)
- Send anyone the direct link to the post (upvotes from direct links get flagged)
- Share the post URL on social media asking for votes
- Instead: share your product URL and mention "I also posted on HN" if at all

## During the Post

**Engage with every comment:**
- HN users are experienced engineers who give harsh, honest feedback
- Thank people for feedback, even negative
- Never get defensive — "good point, I will look into that" goes further than arguing
- Share technical details when asked — the HN audience loves depth
- Admit limitations honestly — "yes, this does not handle X yet"

## What Success Looks Like

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| 50+ points | Good — meaningful exposure |
| 100+ points | Great — front page for a few hours |
| 200+ points | Excellent — front page most of the day |
| 500+ points | Exceptional — top of front page, newsletter mentions |

## After the Post

- Traffic spike lasts 1-2 days, with a long tail from aggregator sites
- HN posts get picked up by tech newsletters and RSS aggregators
- The discussion thread itself becomes a permanent resource
- GitHub stars surge if you linked to a repo
- Write a follow-up blog post about the experience (good for SEO)

## Real Patterns from Successful Show HN Posts

- Posts that tell a personal story ("I was frustrated by X, so I built Y") perform best
- Technical depth in the description drives more upvotes than feature lists
- Open source projects with a clear README get more engagement
- Responding to the first few comments quickly creates momentum
- Posts about solving the poster's own problem feel more authentic
