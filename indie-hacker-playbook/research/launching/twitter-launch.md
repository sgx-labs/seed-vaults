# Twitter/X Launch — Building Momentum with Build-in-Public

## Why X/Twitter Matters for Indie Hackers

X is where the indie hacker community lives. The #buildinpublic movement has created a supportive ecosystem of builders who follow, engage with, and buy from each other. It is both a launch channel and an ongoing distribution channel.

## Pre-Launch: Build Your Audience (2-4 Weeks Before)

### What to Post
1. **Progress updates** — screenshots, code snippets, before/after
2. **Decisions and tradeoffs** — "Chose Supabase over Firebase because..."
3. **Metrics** — waitlist numbers, signup rates, revenue (when you have it)
4. **Failures and pivots** — authenticity builds trust
5. **Quick tips** — share knowledge related to your product domain

### Posting Cadence
- 1-2 posts per day during build phase
- Mix: 70% value/insight, 20% progress, 10% asks
- Engage with other builders' posts daily (reply to 5-10 posts)

### Hashtags
- `#buildinpublic` — the core community
- `#indiehackers` — broader indie builder audience
- `#saas` — if building SaaS
- Product-specific tags as relevant

## Launch Day on X

### The Launch Tweet Formula

```
I just launched [Product Name]

[One sentence: what it does]
[One sentence: who it is for]

[Key feature 1]
[Key feature 2]
[Key feature 3]

[Link]

Built this because [personal story in 1 sentence]

Would love your feedback
```

### Launch Day Actions
1. Pin the launch tweet to your profile
2. Post a thread with the backstory (why you built it, what you learned)
3. Retweet/quote-tweet supportive responses
4. Respond to every reply within 1 hour
5. Share screenshots of traction throughout the day
6. Cross-post to other platforms (PH, IH, Reddit) and mention them on X

## Growing Your X Presence Long-Term

### Content That Performs Well
| Content type | Engagement | Example |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Revenue milestones | Very high | "Just hit $1K MRR. Here is how..." |
| Transparent metrics | High | "Month 3: 47 users, $890 MRR, 5% churn" |
| Lessons learned | High | "3 things I wish I knew before launching" |
| Technical deep dives | Medium | "How I set up Stripe webhooks in 20 minutes" |
| Product updates | Medium | "New feature: [screenshot]" |
| Promotional | Low | "Check out my product!" (avoid standalone promo) |

### Engagement Strategy
- Reply to 10+ tweets daily from other builders
- Quote-tweet interesting takes with your perspective
- Join Twitter Spaces about indie hacking and startups
- DM potential users/partners (sparingly, with value, not pitch)

## Common Mistakes

- Only posting about your product (be a person, not a brand)
- Ignoring engagement (replying to others is how you grow)
- Being inauthentic (sharing only wins, never struggles)
- Posting too much promotional content (rule of thumb: 80% value, 20% promo)
- Expecting overnight growth (building an audience takes 3-6 months minimum)

## Realistic Expectations

- 0-500 followers: 3-6 months of consistent posting
- 500-2,000 followers: 6-12 months
- Each launch tweet reaches 2-5x your follower count if it gets engagement
- Conversion from follower to customer: 0.5-2%
