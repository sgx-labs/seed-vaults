# Reddit Launch — Promoting Without Getting Banned

## The Reddit Paradox

Reddit hates self-promotion but loves useful tools. The key is providing value first and promoting second. A post that genuinely helps people and happens to mention your product will do well. A post that exists only to promote will get removed and you might get banned.

## Subreddits for Indie Hackers

| Subreddit | Focus | Self-promo rules |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| r/SideProject | Side projects and MVPs | Allowed (it is the point) |
| r/SaaS | SaaS products and strategy | Allowed with context |
| r/Entrepreneur | Business and startups | Allowed if it adds value |
| r/webdev | Web development | Allowed if technical |
| r/selfhosted | Self-hostable software | Loved (privacy-focused) |
| r/InternetIsBeautiful | Cool websites | Allowed (must be genuinely useful) |
| [Niche subreddit] | Your specific audience | Read the rules first |

## The Value-First Formula

### 1. Give before you ask
Spend 2+ weeks in the subreddit commenting helpfully on other posts. Build karma and credibility. Do not just lurk — actually contribute.

### 2. Lead with the problem, not the product
**Bad:** "I built a tool that does X, check it out"
**Good:** "I was struggling with X for months. Here is what I learned and the tool I ended up building."

### 3. Share the story
Reddit loves underdog stories. "I am a solo developer who spent evenings building this while working a day job" resonates deeply. Be honest about the journey.

### 4. Ask for feedback
"I just launched the beta and would love feedback from this community" gets way more engagement than "check out my product."

## Post Format That Works

```
Title: I built [product] because [problem] — [result or ask]

Body:
- What problem I was solving (2-3 sentences)
- What I tried before (existing solutions and why they failed)
- What I built (brief description + screenshot/link)
- How it works (technical details if relevant)
- What I learned (1-2 key insights)
- What I need help with (specific ask for feedback)
```

## Timing

- Best posting times: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM EST
- Avoid weekends for serious posts (lower quality engagement)
- Never post the same thing in multiple subreddits simultaneously (looks spammy)
- Space out cross-posts by at least 24 hours

## Common Mistakes

- Posting immediately after joining a subreddit (no credibility)
- Using marketing language ("revolutionary," "game-changing," "disruptive")
- Ignoring negative comments (engage respectfully or do not respond)
- Deleting and reposting if the first attempt fails (Reddit penalizes this)
- Using alt accounts to upvote your own post (Reddit detects this)

## What Good Engagement Looks Like

- 50+ upvotes with meaningful comments = strong signal
- 10-20 comments with detailed feedback = very useful
- Questions about pricing or availability = demand signal
- "I would pay for this" comments = build it yesterday

## Reddit as Ongoing Distribution

Beyond launch posts, Reddit can be a continuous traffic source:
- Answer questions in your domain and naturally mention your tool when relevant
- Share case studies and learnings
- Contribute to "What tools do you use for X?" threads
- Build genuine community relationships
