# Launch Multiplier — Stack Launches for Compound Effect

## The Multi-Launch Strategy

Most indie hackers launch once and wonder why growth stalled. The best founders treat every milestone as a launch opportunity. A single launch is a spike. Multiple launches across different channels create sustained momentum.

## The Launch Calendar

### Week 1: Soft Launch
- Share with beta users and personal network
- Post on Indie Hackers
- Tweet the launch with #buildinpublic

### Week 2: Product Hunt
- Full Product Hunt launch (see `research/launching/product-hunt-playbook.md`)
- Cross-post results to X/Twitter
- Email your waitlist with PH link

### Week 3: Hacker News
- Show HN post (see `research/launching/show-hn-playbook.md`)
- Different framing than PH — more technical, story-driven
- Do NOT reference the PH launch (HN does not like cross-platform promotion)

### Week 4: Reddit
- Post in relevant subreddits (see `research/launching/reddit-launch.md`)
- Lead with value and story, product is secondary
- Different subreddit each day if applicable

### Week 5-8: Content Launch
- Write a blog post about what you learned building it
- Guest post on relevant blogs or newsletters
- Record a demo video for YouTube
- Share on relevant Discord/Slack communities

## Relaunch Triggers

Every one of these is a reason to "launch" again:

| Trigger | How to position it |
|---------|-------------------|
| New major feature | "We just shipped [feature] — here is why" |
| 100 users milestone | "We hit 100 users! Here is what we learned" |
| $1K MRR | "From $0 to $1K MRR — the full breakdown" |
| Integration with popular tool | "Now works with [Notion/Slack/etc.]" |
| Open sourcing a component | "We open-sourced our [component]" |
| Price change | "New pricing — here is our thinking" |
| Major redesign | "We redesigned [product] from scratch" |
| Case study | "How [user type] uses [product] to [outcome]" |

## Channel-Specific Framing

The same news gets framed differently for each channel:

| Channel | Framing style |
|---------|--------------|
| Product Hunt | Feature-focused, visual, polished |
| Show HN | Technical, honest, story-driven |
| Reddit | Community-focused, ask for feedback |
| Twitter/X | Personal, transparent, metrics-driven |
| Indie Hackers | Journey-focused, revenue transparent |
| Blog | SEO-optimized, detailed, evergreen |

## The Compound Effect

Each launch:
1. Brings new users who become word-of-mouth ambassadors
2. Creates backlinks that improve SEO
3. Generates content that can be repurposed
4. Builds your personal brand as a builder
5. Gives you data on what messaging resonates

Over 3-6 months, the cumulative effect of 10-15 "launches" across different channels creates awareness that no single launch could achieve.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating launch as a one-time event
- Using the exact same copy across all channels
- Launching too frequently without real news (audience fatigue)
- Not tracking which channel drives actual signups/revenue
- Forgetting to update your landing page between launches
