# MVP Strategy — What to Build, Fake, and Skip

## The MVP Mindset

An MVP is not a crappy version of your full product. It is the smallest thing that tests your core assumption. If your assumption is "people will pay to automate X," the MVP only needs to automate X. Everything else is noise.

## The Build / Fake / Skip Framework

### Build (must work for real)
- The core value proposition — the ONE thing that makes someone pay
- Payment flow — if you charge, this must work
- Authentication — if users have accounts, this must work
- The "aha moment" — the first experience that shows value

### Fake (simulate manually)
- Onboarding emails — send them manually from your personal email
- Analytics dashboards — use a spreadsheet
- PDF reports — generate them by hand when requested
- Data processing — do it manually, deliver results as if automated
- Customer support — be the support team (email or chat)

### Skip (do not build until you have paying users)
- Admin dashboard
- User settings page
- Email notification preferences
- Team/collaboration features
- Mobile app
- API
- Documentation (beyond a one-page getting started)
- Internationalization
- Dark mode
- Onboarding wizard
- Activity feeds
- User profiles
- Export features

## Time Budget

| Approach | Time to first user |
|----------|-------------------|
| Landing page only | 1-2 days |
| No-code MVP | 3-7 days |
| Boilerplate MVP | 1-2 weeks |
| Custom MVP | 2-4 weeks |
| "Proper" MVP | 4-8 weeks (danger zone) |
| Beyond 8 weeks | You are over-building |

## The Wizard of Oz MVP

Concierge/Wizard of Oz: the user thinks the product is automated, but you are doing the work manually behind the scenes.

Examples:
- Zapier started as manual integration work done by humans
- Food delivery apps started with founders personally delivering food
- Many AI startups manually handle edge cases while building automation

This works because users care about the RESULT, not the mechanism. If you can deliver the result manually to 10 users, you validate demand without writing complex code.

## When Is the MVP Done?

The MVP is done when:
1. A stranger can sign up and get value without your help
2. They can pay you (if it is a paid product)
3. You can measure whether they come back

The MVP is NOT done when:
- It does everything you imagined
- The code is clean
- The design is polished
- You feel confident showing it to people

## Real Examples

- Pieter Levels built early versions of Nomad List as a simple spreadsheet shared publicly, then turned it into a product after validation
- Marc Lou ships MVPs in under 2 weeks using his own ShipFast boilerplate, launching 17 products in 2 years
- Habit Pixel launched as a bare-bones iOS app and grew to $1K MRR in 8 months by iterating based on user feedback
